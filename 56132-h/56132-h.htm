<p class='c005'>The absence of any but fragmentary information on EARTH-SLIPS
<span class='fss'>AND</span> SUBSIDENCES <span class='fss'>UPON</span> PUBLIC WORKS, one of
the most annoying and expensive occurrences in engineering
construction, has prompted the author to write this book as
a vade-mecum for those in charge of such undertakings
as <em>Railways</em>, <em>Docks</em>, <em>Canals</em>, <em>Roads</em>, <em>Waterworks</em>, <em>River-banks</em>,
<em>Reclamation embankments</em>, <em>Drainage works</em>, &amp;c., and also to fill,
however imperfectly, somewhat of an hiatus in engineering
literature.</p>

<p class='c000'>The theory of the lateral pressure of earthwork is not
examined, as it is well understood; the intention being
to concisely describe the chief causes of slips and subsidences
in different earths and many points requiring
attention, to call to remembrance some soils especially
treacherous and unstable, and to name various preventive
measures and effectual remedies.</p>

<p class='c000'>A reference to the table of contents and the index will
demonstrate the comprehensiveness of the subject, for it
involves in the various practical applications the science of
geology, physical geography, meteorology, the laws of pressure
of earth, some chemical and botanical, and other scientific
knowledge.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>It is scarcely necessary to observe that no exhaustive
treatise is herein attempted, for that would indeed be an
Herculean task; but in this volume the endeavour has been
made to present reliable information, the result of experience,
research, considerable labour, and lengthened observation.</p>

<p class='c005'>Earthslips and subsidences may be caused by the terrible
power of an earthquake or other dreaded subterranean destroying
force, upheaving, cracking, and shattering the earth’s
crust and dealing death and havoc in its awe-inspiring
course. They may also originate from the untiring efforts of
the meanest rodents or the most minute crustaceous animals
burrowing passages for aqueous action, the chief agent of the
instability of the surface soils of the earth.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is the constant absence of peace and rest in the earth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>that produces instability, however great, however small, for
the disastrous landslips that have occurred in Switzerland
and other parts of Europe, in India, and recently at Quebec,
and in all regions of the world were caused by the same
disintegrating operations as those which generate an earth-slip
of comparative insignificance. In proceeding to a
practical consideration of earthslips and subsidences, it may
be well to call attention to the complexity of the subject,
the character and conditions of earth and the impairing
elements being so very variable and numerous that it is
impossible to determine any rules even for a particular soil;
and, moreover, it is necessary to separately consider slips in
cuttings and those in embankments, as movement is somewhat
differently created, and it does not necessarily follow because
earth stands well in a cutting that it will do so in an embankment,
or <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versâ</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be said every kind of earth will slip or weather
under certain conditions, even the hardest rock if superimposed
upon an unstable stratum; therefore, some of the
main questions to be considered are:—</p>

<p class='c014'>I. <span class='sc'>The Probability of the Occurrence of a Slip.</span></p>

<p class='c014'>II. <span class='sc'>The Effect of a Slip.</span></p>

<p class='c014'>III. <span class='sc'>Should every Precaution be taken to prevent a Slip
when a Cutting is being Excavated or an Embankment
being Deposited; or is it better to Repair a Slip as it
happens?</span></p>

<p class='c000'>It is obvious in railway cuttings and embankments a mere
crumbling of the surface may be disregarded, but in dock,
canal, or any works containing or expelling water, the
smallest movement, crack, or aperture must immediately
receive due attention.</p>

<p class='c000'>In order to effectually remedy a disease it is necessary to
ascertain its character. Many of the primary causes of slips
in cuttings and embankments are, therefore, here enumerated;
but, of course, they are not named in their order of importance,
which cannot be established.</p>

by the action of water or meteorological influences.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. The temporary or permanent exposure of the earth to the
effects of the atmosphere, rain, frost, and snow.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. The opening to the air and weather, &amp;c., of thin seams
of an unstable character, which, when unsupported, gradually

being loosened and blown away by a storm of wind, especially
when it is accompanied by rain.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. The slopes being honey-combed and disturbed by
rodents, particularly in clay soils, clay marls, and clay
loams; and upon submerged earthwork, and in certain

another to disintegrating meteorological influences.</p>

underground waters.</p>

<p class='c000'>14. By allowing water to accumulate in the gullet, or
upon the formation during the process of the excavation of a
cutting.</p>

<p class='c000'>19. Insufficient flatness of a slope either at the time of
excavation or after exposure to meteorological influences.</p>

<p class='c000'>20. The strain upon the face from lumps of earth being
allowed to remain upon a slope during the construction of
the works, or the gullet being excavated for a considerable

unduly and unequally strained.</p>

<p class='c000'>21. By overweighting.</p>

<p class='c000'>22. By unequal loading.</p>

<p class='c000'>23. The establishment of spoil banks upon the cess, or
the additional loading of the ground near and outside a

support, especially in soils partaking of a semi-fluid
character.</p>

<p class='c000'>25. The want of uniformity of the covering of a slope

wall at the foot of a slope, resulting in the stability of the
wall being overcome by pressure.</p>

<p class='c000'>29. By unequal pressure upon the foundations of a
retaining wall at the foot of a slope caused by lateral over-pressure
tilting it, or by its unequal settlement.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>30. In sidelong ground, by the removal of support against
the action of sliding, which, without artificial aid, may
not be arrested until the slope of a cutting on the higher
side approaches the steepest inclination of the face of the hill.</p>

<p class='c000'>31. By blasting laminated rock dipping at a considerable
angle towards a cutting in the side of a hill; the result

<p class='c000'>26. An embankment not being tipped to its full width as
it progresses, whether in one or more wagon roads.</p>

<p class='c000'>27. First tipping the central portion of an embankment,
and completing the width and slope by side deposition
after some time has elapsed.</p>

<p class='c000'>28. Tipping the contents of earth wagons from a considerable
height, thereby loosening and separating the soil, causing
the larger and heavier material to be near the foot of a slope
and in lumps, and an embankment to have interstices and be
temporarily or permanently unstable.</p>

<p class='c000'>29. Irregular consolidation, artificial or otherwise.</p>

<p class='c000'>30. Unequal exposure, particularly in embankments upon

<p class='c000'>In the case of earthworks made to contain or exclude
water for the purposes of docks, canals, waterworks,
reclamation of land, irrigation or drainage, &amp;c., may be
added, without reference to their construction:—</p>

<p class='c000'>1. Leakage along a discharge culvert, sluice, or tunnel in

rubbing or colliding against a slope.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. From erosion caused by wave action produced by the
passage of boats or ships propelled by machinery; or by
wind waves.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. Variation in the water level, causing unequal pressure.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. In the case of a reclamation embankment, it being
closed from the ends, and not by raising in layers, from the
ground level.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. Variation of the submerged area, and consequent change
in the degree of exposure to deteriorating influences.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c000'>To sum up, the principal causes of slips in earthwork may
be stated to be air, water, frost and thaw, over-pressure, and
vibration; the chief agent both in cuttings and embankments
being water, which forces forward the surface of the slopes
and destroys the cohesion of the soil, and impairs its frictional
resistance until the earth is unable to sustain the weight
upon it; vibration aiding and completing the movement,
as it not only tends to loosen the soil, but may disturb the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>equilibrium of earthwork which is almost moving, and
only requires a slight shock to set it in motion: in fact,
vibration is frequently the complementary agency that
causes a slip, and is obviously felt most in loose soils; but if
there should be fissures in earth of a tenacious character, or
boulders in clay to disconnect it, the effect of vibration will
be more serious in the latter case, as whole masses of earth
may become detached, instead of an equal settlement proceeding
as with soils, such as sand and gravel, which may become
consolidated by shaking, owing to wedging of the particles,
should the slopes be sufficiently flat to prevent lateral
movement; but it may detach portions of the slopes in
soil having little or no cohesion, and thus initiate a slip.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the following chapters the chief causes of slips in
cuttings and embankments are considered, together with
others bearing upon a solution of the subject, which is so
interwoven that it is impracticable to preserve a successive
order, but an endeavour has been made to separately indicate
the cause and some remedies that may be adopted: but
before proceeding to particularise, it may be well to name
a few dominant principles of the alignment of public works,
which if duly regarded may tend to prevent slips of serious
importance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Consequent upon financial and other causes, an engineer
is usually required to so quickly prepare the necessary
parliamentary plans and sections of public works, more
particularly for railways, that it is beyond the power of
the most experienced to set out in a few hours the best
line of railway, &amp;c., across a country, giving due consideration
to the parliamentary, constructional, economical working,
district and through traffic, and financial requirements of
the undertaking. There are, however, a few points which
he may be able to regard respecting the stability of earthworks,
some of which are now enumerated.</p>

<p class='c000'>1. Avoid cuttings or embankments in drift soil in or upon
the side of a hill.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. Avoid all damming back or flow of the natural drainage
waters, or heaping of snow by the erection of an embankment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>especially in mountainous, hilly, or sidelong ground, and in
an undrained district.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. When any excavation is in the side of a hill, observe
the natural configuration of the ground in the wettest part,
and remember that the slope of a cutting may not stand
unless at the same inclination, or the toe of the slope is
supported by a massive retaining wall and extensive
draining, and that any disturbance may cause it to require
a flatter inclination.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. Avoid river or stream diversions in earth of a very
porous character; and should an embankment have to be
erected near to a deep river having a steep bank, locate the
line a sufficient distance from the edge that the slope of the
river bank may be flattened when required, as an extraordinary
flood may cause it to be unstable and to fall in,
and in order to restore it to a condition of stability, it may
be necessary to widen the river and reduce the angle of
inclination of its banks.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. In treacherous earth do not locate a railway close to a
road, except at a station, as if the line be placed above the
road, a slip upon the railway may result in a slip upon the
road; and should the line be below a road, the extra weight
or vibration may cause the road to follow the railway and
act, as it were, in unison with it.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. In treacherous soil, where practicable, have stations
nearly upon the surface of the natural ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. Remember that upon one side of even the narrowest
gorge or valley the earth may be much more solid than upon
the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. In exposed situations in a hilly country ascertain upon
which side snow remains the longer, note which receives the
greater amount of sunshine, and is the wetter and more
covered with trees and vegetation. In a hill or mountain,
the side to leeward of the prevailing winds almost invariably
receives the greater rainfall.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. In mountainous or hilly districts it may be advantageous
to place a railway or road at a high level upon the sunny
side of a hill or valley, as obviously it dries quicker; snow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>does not accumulate with the same facility, unless it happens
to be exposed to the direction of the prevailing storms; the
sunny side may be practically clear of snow, the shady almost
impassable; but there is one drawback to the sunny side,
namely—the more frequent occurrence of snow-slips, which
may or may not be serious in extent. On the whole, experience
seems to show that the wooded side of a valley
is the best to select—sometimes one side is bare and the
other wooded—unless there are special reasons to the contrary.
In the winter season in certain districts abroad, for instance,
in parts of Afghanistan and the adjacent mountain passes,
the days are sometimes as hot as the summer of European
countries, but at night the thermometer may fall below
freezing-point, hence the value of tree-protection. It is
obvious that in such climates the soil is peculiarly liable
to disintegrating forces, and likely to slip, unless of a solid
character, and that upon one side earthworks may be stable,
and upon the other treacherous.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. In many countries it may be advisable to adopt a
valley in preference to a hill-side line, especially if the
district is free from floods, or if the waters flowing down
the side of the hills are considerable and suddenly appear,
and there is a river and ample means available of controlling
the hill-side torrents and conducting them to the river. If
not, and the line must be on the mountain side, it may be
advisable, in exposed places where water rapidly accumulates
and becomes a torrent, to adopt the system of short tunnels
round the hill spurs, in preference to deep cuttings, drainage,
and slope protection works, and to place the railway or road at
the highest level, so as to be free from the influence of floods.</p>

<p class='c000'>11. Bear in mind that in high mountainous districts the
drift deposit is generally torrential alluvium.</p>

<p class='c000'>12. Avoid as much as possible high embanked approaches
to a river bridge, especially when a deep river, which
frequently changes its course, is in a flat country.</p>

<p class='c000'>13. Consider if the simple erection of an embankment may
in time cause its destruction, by the arrest or attempted
diversion of the usual flow of the land waters.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>14. In treacherous soils, on the side of a cliff facing the
sea, determine whether it is preferable to erect timber trestles
at its base instead of a solid embankment, or to place the
line in a tunnel. The trestles can either be erected upon
sills, resting on the ground and on short piles well secured
from movement, or on piles driven some distance into the
ground. The system may also be adopted if the ground be
of a yielding character.</p>

<p class='c000'>15. It has been noticed in some mountainous districts that
the clouds break against the highest main ranges, discharge
themselves on the smaller ranges, and generally do not reach
the inner ranges which rise on the high table-lands; therefore,
consider whether by locating a railway or road near
the latter, there is much less probability of a slip in the
earthworks and less provision required for surface and flood
waters.</p>

<p class='c000'>16. The configuration of a district through which a railway
or road must be aligned, may be such that its location
becomes one more based upon placing it on soil which
is less bad or treacherous, than upon firm or stable ground.
This is especially the case in hilly countries contiguous to
the sea or large rivers. It may be optional to construct the
works upon low or valley ground upon the side of a mountain
or hill, or close to the sea shore or a river bank, which may
require continuous defence works to protect it from waves
and erosion; or on table-land which, however, if impervious
and retentive of moisture may act as a catchment reservoir
between hills, and cause the ground to be always in a damp
state.</p>

<p class='c000'>The character of the soil, the magnitude, and especially
the average height of the embankments, or the depth of the
cuttings, the easy drainage and discharge of the rainfall, and
an economically constructed, maintained, and worked line
are the chief conditions to inseparably bear in mind in
determining the location.</p>

Conditions under which Slips and Subsidences
in Cuttings and Embankments may be expected in different
Earths, such as Rock, Chalk, Sand, Gravel, Clay, &amp;c., &amp;c.,—Notes
on the Slopes of Repose.</span></p>

<p class='c005'>It is of importance to know when serious slips are most
likely to happen and under what conditions they are
probable, for the process of disintegration may commence
immediately the earth is excavated, and be very gradual,
although the soil may remain stable for many months, or
even a year or two, because the earth has not had time to be
affected to the point of instability.</p>

<p class='c000'>The history of recorded slips appears to indicate that the
most serious movements of earth and those most difficult to
remedy occur in the following soils.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Drift Earth</span> upon rock in sidelong ground.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Chalk Soils</span>, as witness the slips in the early part of 1877
in the cuttings near Folkestone, and the more recent on the
Calais-Boulogne Railway, and that in an embankment of
chalk at Binham’s Wood, near Balcombe, in October 1853,
when in a length of about 200 yards some 70,000 cubic yards
of earth slipped towards a valley. Probably this is one of
the most extensive recorded slips of a railway embankment
of chalk; however, in this case the traffic was not stopped,
but only delayed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Clay Soils</span>, especially the yellow clay; illustrated by the
notable slip at New Cross, near London, when some 90,000
cubic yards of yellow clay moved upon the smooth surface of
a shaly clay bed and covered the formation: also the brown,
and boulder clay, and the lias clays, as witness the well-known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>recorded slips in the Midland counties of England,
in which either aluminous or calcareous material may preponderate.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are few, if any, earths in which the cohesion, weight-sustaining
power and ability to resist the action of water and
meteorological influences are practically the same at all
depths, the different conditions, arrangement, and character
in which they are found being almost infinite, and there are
earths which may become consolidated and watertight if in a
constantly moist and protected state, that when dry and
exposed will shrink, fissure, and soon become unstable.</p>

<p class='c000'>Consequent upon cohesion, a cutting may stand for some
time almost vertically; nevertheless stability cannot be considered
as solely regulated by the cohesion of earth, for an
embankment of gravel, sand, or broken rock with a proper
slope and protected from erosion will usually safely bear
more load than an embankment of clay, although the former
material may be said to have no cohesion; but the lateral
thrust of dry, firm sand is known to be small, provided the
sand is not disturbed; also no earth can be said to be immovable
under every condition, but consideration of the soils
particularly liable to disturbance or mutation is, under
ordinary circumstances, the main question to be determined.</p>

<p class='c000'>With few exceptions the exterior or faces of cuttings and
embankments will, at certain times, become impaired or
soddened by the infiltration of water. In cuttings there is
the additional danger, owing to the geological formation, of
the excavation reaching the depth at which water is generally
found in the locality, and it is therefore advisable to ascertain
this level, and also to decide whether the ground must be
excavated below it, as necessarily there will be a downward
flow, and the slopes and formation will consequently have to
sustain a pressure due to the difference between the normal
level of the water-bearing stratum in the neighbourhood and
that of any depth beneath it. In such a case, in addition to
the usual softening and loosening aqueous action, there is the
particular insecurity of the formation and slopes being undermined
and eroded by springs: also in pervious soil in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>drained district a cutting will be found to be comparatively
dry to about the level of the bottom of the existing contiguous
drains, but below that depth water will be present,
probably in considerable quantity. Land drains also frequently
cause slips, as they localise the flow of the surface or
underground waters, and when in excavating a cutting they
are intercepted, the discharge should be led away from the
slopes; but difficulty may be encountered in effecting this, as
water will usually follow its original course, and it may be
impossible to entirely divert the direction of the flow, and
the only thing to do may be to gently conduct the water
down the slope by means of pipes, rubble, burnt brick, gravel
surface drains, or timber ducts.</p>

<p class='c000'>An important question to determine is, when are slips in
earthwork most likely to occur.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Europe they are most frequent in the autumn and
winter months; but no rule can be established, nor is it
reasonable to conclude, because any earthwork has remained
stable during the usual period when slips may be expected,
that, therefore, none will happen, for the heaviest rain may
descend at an unusual season, and as moisture is the chief
cause of the instability of all earths, it is rather to the
quantity of the rainfall at any time than to the fixed seasons
that attention should be directed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Spring being the driest season in England and autumn
the wettest, October and November being the months of
heaviest rainfall, slips are more probable in the latter than
the former season; but the first heavy and continuous rainfall
after a period of estival drought is that particularly to
be feared, or the first rainy weather after a dry period
irrespective of the season of the year; but serious slips may
not occur for many days or until the expiration of even a
month or two after such rainfall, as the ground waters
require time before they percolate to or reach the site of a
cutting, and, therefore, all danger may be thought to be past
when it is steadily approaching. The autumnal rains have
to replace the moisture that has evaporated during the
summer, and this may not, and usually does not if it slowly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>proceeds, produce instability in earthwork; but immediately
the rainfall approaches or becomes in excess of the power of
the natural absorption of the soil, the rain must flow away,
for the earth being fully charged cannot contain it, the
surface becomes wet or the mass soaked, according to the
degree of the permeability of the soil, and the quantity of
rain necessary to produce saturation; therefore, the state of
the earth that induces a slip is that most desirable to know;
this cannot be absolutely established in every case, for it
depends upon so many influences, and obviously varies
according to the character of the earth, the varieties and
conditions of which are practically infinite.</p>

<p class='c000'>In countries that have dry and wet seasons, which cause
the earth to become parched and then to be rapidly
saturated, mere surface waters to become streams, and rivers
torrents, slips are probable soon after the commencement of
the rainy season.</p>

<p class='c000'>When frost follows rain or a fall of snow, and the latter
has descended upon a frozen surface and a thaw sets in,
particularly if it be accompanied by a warm wind causing it
to be very rapid in action, the earth is severely tried, for
the frozen water in the ground becomes suddenly liberated,
while the surface is in a state of saturation. Probably the
worst event that can occur for causing floods is when a
sudden and rapid thaw follows a heavy snowfall upon frozen
earth, as then the snow will melt, and water cannot gently
percolate the earth, as the surface will be in a more or less
frozen and impermeable condition, and the snow-water
consequently must flow away.</p>

<p class='c000'>Should any excessive or violent rainfall succeed a period
during which the heat of the sun has caused fissures in the
surface of the earth, allowing water to enter, the state of the
soil is favourable to movement. Land has also become
unstable in mountainous countries because a district has
been deforested, or tree-protection much reduced, movement
of the earth usually happening after the first heavy rains or
thaw succeeding frost or snow.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has also been noticed that when an earth has become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>completely saturated or water-charged, a sudden fall of
the barometer to a low pressure will liberate the pent up
water which the soil cannot contain and cause it to burst
out, the equilibrium having been so delicate. Under such
circumstances slips are nearly sure to ensue, and to be
serious from their sudden action.</p>

<p class='c000'>Extensive slips in earthwork seldom occur during the
excavation, or a short time after the completion of a cutting;
on the other hand, movement in an embankment frequently
happens during deposition. In the case of an embankment,
time may cause the earth to become consolidated, but in a
cutting the disintegrating and disturbing forces, and the
combined action of air and water percolating until they
force forward the earth, are usually gradual in their
operation, and often require a year or two to cause a state of
instability; in fact, the history of slips, with a few exceptions,
in soils whose condition is very readily changed by water,
indicates that serious movement in cuttings does not
generally occur until a cycle or two of the seasons has
elapsed, during which period meteorological influences, aided
by vibration and other deteriorating operations, are slowly
and regularly proceeding, until at length such a change in
the general condition is caused that a slip happens,
apparently from some sudden agency, whereas the stability
of the earth has been gradually and surely wasting away
for a long time; hence the importance of continual careful
observation in cuttings even of moderate depth in doubtful
soil.</p>

<p class='c000'>In canals and works of a similar character constructed to
contain water, if any movement or slip of earthwork takes
place, it usually occurs within a short time of the water
being admitted, and generally within a few months and
seldom after so long a period as a year, the ground in a short
time becoming consolidated, being exempt from severe
vibration and many of the disturbing agencies present in
railway cuttings and embankments.</p>

<p class='c000'>In endeavouring to ascertain the probability of a slip
occurring, not only should the superficial strata be considered,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>but also the original formation of the country; for instance,
drift-soil, which is generally met with upon the surface of
sloping rocks, may consist of various earths intermixed in
endless variety, and in every conceivable shape, and is not
necessarily produced by a weathering of the rock upon
which it lies, for it may have been brought from a distance.
In any case, drift-soil is the result of decomposition and
disintegration, and from its nature is unreliable and ever
subject to change, to slip, and to subside, and so are most of
the glacial deposits and moraine found in mountainous
countries; and whenever the contour of a district is
irregular and has numerous clefts, soft and marshy places,
valleys and hills, earthworks will require to be protected
against slips; also, should a cutting be at the base of a cliff
or hill, it will probably have to be excavated in drift deposit
and, perhaps, in silt if below the water-level of adjacent sea
or river, and the ground dips towards the natural outfall of
the land-waters. Such drift-soil may be alternately dry and
charged with water from the rocks above, especially if they
are much fissured and water-bearing and permit easy
percolation of water, and must always be in a state of
mutability.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><span class='sc'>Rock.</span></h3>

<p class='c016'>With regard to slips in rock, or earth generally classed as
rock, the unstratified or igneous rocks, although they are
sometimes traversed by mineral veins and dykes, are the
less likely to slip; but rocks liable to surface decomposition
and disintegration, such as some varieties of basalt and clay-slate,
which latter by atmospheric and aqueous action will
partly return to its original state of being fine mud, thrown
down from the metamorphic rocks, may change their
condition and are likely to slip; and also limestone rock,
which however resists the eroding action of water better
than sandstone, may become separated by frost although its
surface soon dries.</p>

<p class='c000'>Simply knowing the general character of a rock without
ascertaining the proportion, state of the different particles of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>which it is composed, and whether any metamorphic action
has taken place, is not necessarily a reliable guide to its
stability. In districts situated at a high level, rocks are
usually less permeable than in low-lying lands, and the
surface discharge is greater and quicker because of the
increased rainfall, and less absorption and retention of water.</p>

<p class='c000'>It should be noticed whether there are dips in the surface
of rock, as they often contain unreliable material, such as
pockets and pot-holes of clay, sand, mud, silt and detritus;
and movement may be expected if it be carelessly tipped
with the rock into an embankment. Rocks which oppose
vegetation are usually hard and weather-resisting, and the
faults and fissures local; but it is not so much the equal
weathering of the face of rocks that is to be feared, as the
presence and interspersion of seams, breaks and fissures, and
it should always be borne in mind that the condition of a
rock varies considerably—it may be sound in one place, and
be fissured, disintegrated, and quickly weather in others—and
that all laminated and fissile earths are liable to slip because
of the percolation of water down veins and crevices.</p>

<p class='c000'>The durability of a rock may be approximately known by
a careful examination, commencing at the surface of the
ground and proceeding until it is reached, the thickness and
character of the different top soils being noted, and
particularly whether the degradation is uniform; but rock,
such as some sandstone, which allows water to ooze,
permeate, or force a passage, is of doubtful stability.
Weathering may be possible only upon the surface or may
gradually extend downwards, and as it can hardly be called
a slip, the point to ascertain is not so much that it is sound
and weather-resisting, as to know that there is no chance of
any portion becoming detached or sliding, through the
cohesion of the joints being impaired or destroyed by water,
frost, or other agencies; for in the case of rocks which show
irregularities of stratification, much cleavage, or are
separated by upheaval, or have synclinal and anticlinal
folds, masses become detached along the line of cleavage and
independently of the normal stratification, therefore fissures
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>or faults, weak veins between masses of rock and crevices, or
inclined beds through which water may flow and always be
present; the direction and inclination of the dip of the
strata, effects of weather upon the veins, and to know the
weight upon sloping ground which the rock will bear
without sliding down a hill are the main considerations; for
rocks may be distorted, upraised, contorted and tilted at
every angle, and even horizontal beds may repose upon the
upturned edges of other strata.</p>

<p class='c000'>An inclined water-bearing stratum between rock loosely
bedded and inclined towards a cutting, unless drained and
supported, will probably cause a slip consequent upon the
action of water or frost; on the other hand, veins may alone
hold the masses together, and, therefore, when they are affected
the cementing medium is destroyed; however, inclined water
seams are a frequent cause of slips, for where any water-bearing
earth meets a closer and consequently less pervious
stratum, damp surfaces are produced, and an unstable
condition; consequently, mixtures of rock, clay, and sand,
are usually troublesome. Also in a cutting in sidelong
ground if a stratified rock dips parallel, or nearly so, to the
slope of a hill, slips are probable, as it may slide towards
the cutting. Similarly, in a cutting in drift or alluvial soil,
or any that will quickly weather, resting upon rock,
especially should it have a smooth bed inclining towards the
formation, the superimposed earth will usually be unstable,
and even the act of penetrating the top stratum, or the
erection of a retaining wall or the weight of a small embankment
upon it, may cause it to move; and when motion has
commenced it is difficult to arrest it; and should water
trickle upon the surface of the rock, it may cause the upper
stratum to slide; also when water flows or remains upon
rock having a superimposed bed of shale or clay, the top
stratum may not remain at rest even though the surface of
the rock may be nearly level and practically waterproof, and
where rock beds overlie shale which is liable to become
softened by time and water and to perish, particularly when
the beds are twisted or contorted; as, for instance, limestone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>or sandstone upon shale or marly-shale, the latter becoming
softened by the action of the atmosphere, water, or frost
will form a sliding medium upon which the rock may move,
or should shale overlie rock, as it frequently does, it may
slide upon the hard surface. All alternate beds of shale or
any softer earth than the rock, particularly broken shales
when found mixed with sand and clay and the lias shales, and
rock should be regarded as treacherous and liable to slip.
Also some of the slate rocks, as they frequently have veins of
limestone, &amp;c., and as the latter decomposes it mixes with
the clay and becomes of a marly character. Dark blue shale or
indurated slaty clay is sometimes difficult to excavate, but
when exposed to atmospheric and aqueous action it breaks
into pieces and becomes little better than a treacherous clay.
The cohesion of shale becomes less as it approaches a greasy
clayey condition, and, therefore, one readily affected by
water or air, and it may then not stand at a steeper slope
than 3 to 1. Rock and shale, which may stand at a steep
inclination provided the beds are horizontal, it has been
found, do not permanently repose when they dip towards a
cutting until as flat a slope as 2 to 1 is given; and where
clay and shale beds in cuttings are present, a slope of 1½ to
1 has been insufficient, and they have not been stable till an
inclination of 2 to 1 has been adopted.</p>

<p class='c000'>As cuttings in rock are frequently in the side of a hill, the
dip of the strata should be ascertained, and in the case of an
unstratified rock, it should be known whether it is fissured or
lies upon a solid and firm bed considerably below the level
of a cutting, so that it may be prevented from movement.
It should also be ascertained if the top stratum is a mere
crust, such as a capping of conglomerate resting upon clay-rock,
through which water may burst and cause it to
separate, and sometimes the rock may be more solid in the
valleys than upon the hill-side because of greater diluvial
action, and induration caused by exposure.</p>

<p class='c000'>The crystalline rocks are the least easily destroyed and
are generally rough and jagged. The science of geology
shows that limestones, sandstones and clays, were originally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>heaps of mud deposited, removed or arranged by water; and
that boulders are transplanted masses from the parent rock,
and are worn and rounded by mechanical attrition. Consideration
of the manner in which rocks have been formed
affords a fair indication of their stability in earthwork; for
instance, many clay rocks are reduced to a pasty condition
by the action of water and air, but with different results
according to their nature, some requiring blasting to
excavate them. On the other hand, there are sandstones
which although soft in the quarry become hardened when
exposed to the atmosphere. A dock cut in red sandstone
when exposed to the atmosphere may slip and fail, but if the
rock be protected from the weather or constantly covered
with water it may be reliable.</p>

<p class='c000'>As cuttings are near the surface and seldom at greater
depths than 100 feet, it is hardly possible to know the angle
at which a rock dips or whether there are faults and fissures
in it, unless an examination is made upon the site, and this
notwithstanding the geological character may be thoroughly
understood. Local conditions may cause peculiarities which
no law can determine, and although at considerable depths,
deeper than railway or any works with the exception of well-sinking
and mining are likely to reach, the nature of the
earth is accurately ascertained; the surface soil may be in
almost every conceivable variety, and also so dislocated,
denuded and rearranged, that usually horizontal strata may
be nearly vertical. Its character may be accurately known,
but the lie of the surface beds or dip of the upper strata, or
the order of supraposition cannot be invariably absolutely
established; for instance, when crevasses, fissures and veins
are frequent in earth upheaved and disintegrated by volcanic
action, earthquakes and other disturbing causes, as in parts
of South America, Japan, and other eastern countries, Italy,
the Tyrol, Spain, &amp;c., &amp;c., slips of earthwork are to be
expected, and the soil is likely to be much inclined, full of
faults and probably water-bearing seams.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under the comprehensive name of rock is usually included
any earth from the hardest mass to be found to that which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>will crumble in the hand, as soft sandstone rock. The chief
absorbent rocks with which engineers have to do are the
limestones, sandstones, chalk, and clay rocks. Rock may also
be simple or present the appearance of being homogeneous, or
it may be a mass of different substances, be flat bedded, have
open or close joints, and be what is called—</p>

disintegrated and dissolved; therefore the angle of repose
varies considerably, but the following cardinal principles

and conditions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Schistose rock is troublesome in earthwork, being fissile
in structure and deleteriously affected by rain and the
atmosphere. On the Panama canal works in the Culebra
cutting, maximum depth 333 feet 6 inches, numerous slips
occurred, displaced the roads, and overturned the excavators.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mica-schist is variable and frequently has numerous water-bearing
fissures. Its hardness depends upon the quantity of
quartz it contains; when the proportion of mica is greater
than the quartz it is soft and very fissured and contains
veins, sometimes of clay, often yielding a considerable flow of
water. Should the percentage of quartz be large it becomes
hard, holds little water, and is of a gneissose character.</p>

<p class='c000'>As water is the chief disintegrating agent and cause of
instability, it may be well to mention that Professor Prestwich
has stated that “hard quartzites, slates and grits (Silurian),
purple and grey shales, schists and fissile sandstones with
hard compact limestones and dolomites (Devonian), rarely
contain any <em>levels</em> of water, and that it is only encountered
in fissures”; hence the importance of knowing the position
of the fissures, and taking the necessary precautions to
promote stability. Where rocks, especially if generally
known as water-bearing, crop out at a high angle, and are in
well-defined beds, water may be expected, as although it may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>not percolate vertically, it will along the inclined beds.
Sandstone and limestone bands in rock usually cause small
springs.</p>

<p class='c000'>The stability of a sandstone for earthwork and purposes of
construction is dependent upon the material which cements or
holds it together, whether iron rust, lime, free silica, alumina,
&amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., its quantity and condition, and the degree of
hardness imparted when it was formed, and the nature of
the agglutinant; therefore the varieties and degrees of
fineness and hardness are numerous. Sandstones are
generally found to be laminated when hard; and bare of
vegetation if pure and free from marls; they contain
and part with water in different proportions, and sometimes
have watertight bands crossing them, severing water communication,
which may cause earthworks to be of unequal
stability. The firmest and strongest are close-grained and
fine in texture, the weaker are coarse and gritty, and have
a sandy appearance. They may be white, yellow, green,
black, red, grey, brown, or other colour, and although of
the same hue, their character may not be identical; for
instance, the red sandstone is hard and also very soft.
Sandstone of a greenish hue is generally hard, much fissured
and full of water. When firm, greensand may stand at a
steep slope, the surface being protected; but it varies
considerably, and may at one place be close and yet be
gradually deteriorated until it is of the character of fine
loose sand.</p>

<p class='c000'>Should it be found upon excavating sandstone that it is
not upon its natural bed, but distorted, upheaved, or vertical,
it will probably split and become detached under the
destructive action of air and water. In tropical climates it
has been found that sandstones generally dissolve and become
disintegrated when used in damp foundations. Limestone
also varies much in character, and is treacherous, whether it
is hard or soft, when pockets of clay or sand are present and
beds of clay are contiguous. Percolated water having
carbonic acid in it may also soften or dissolve it. The softer
kinds if in fragments as ballast, or when deposited in an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>embankment, often become quickly disintegrated by frost
and the weather, as do sandstones.</p>

<p class='c000'>Should any rock strata be vertically inclined instead of
horizontal, although it may be known in the latter case they
are generally watertight, fissures in the upheaved beds may
become channels for the passage of the subsiding or rising
waters, and may cause saturation of the soil over a
considerable area and induce a flow through the slopes or
the seat of an embankment. Upon such a site no reservoir,
dock, canal, or any earthen structure to hold water should
be placed; but although the nature of the ground may be
fatal to the stability of such an embankment, so long as the
underground waters do not rise to the level of the seat of a
railway embankment or flood a cutting or burst the slopes,
they may not seriously affect the stability; for, unless the
head level of supply is great, more danger maybe expected
from downward percolation saturating the ground upon
which the embankment is placed than from an upward
flow. The insecurity of erecting a reservoir or similar work
upon such a site, in which water is brought into a district
in greater quantity than its natural flow, is obvious, as the
earth may gradually become saturated from the constant
leakage down the upheaved fissures, until it becomes in an
unstable condition and finally slips and subsides.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><span class='sc'>Chalk.</span></h3>

<p class='c016'>As in most public works, with the except:on of tunnels,
wells and mines, the chalk with which an engineer has to
deal is surface chalk, or the top layers of that deposit known
as the upper chalk, almost invariably containing much more
water than the lower chalk, although it rises quicker in the
lower beds, as it is under greater pressure, and which vary in
hardness, purity, and solidity and may have frequent
fissures and holes, with or without flints, and be anything
from hard, compact chalk rock to mere marly calcareous
earth; considerable judgment is required to successfully
determine the slope of stability and the precautionary works
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>that may be necessary to attain repose; for some of the
upper beds soon weather, and being soft, friable, and
fissured are permeable and liable to slip; in fact, the Oolitic
series, as it consists of alternating bands of limestones and
clays and occasionally sandstone, is frequently fissured and
has loose joints and therefore requires to be carefully
treated.</p>

<p class='c000'>The range of the slope of permanent stability obviously
depends upon the nature of the chalk, whether it is denuded
or covered or mere loose-jointed strata, the effect ground and
surface waters may have upon it, and also the position of the
beds, and whether a cutting or embankment is on the side or
the base of a hill, and consequently at the place where it is
likely to be in a wet condition.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Needle-rocks in the Isle of Wight and Beachy Head
may be mentioned as familiar examples, showing that firm
and comparatively pure chalk will stand practically
perpendicular, even when much exposed, if pure and free
from faults and homogeneous in texture; and in blocks with
beds inclined away from a cutting it will permanently stand</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Much depends upon its freedom from faults, crevices, and
pot-holes, as they hold water, and the surrounding soil may
fall away, for water quickly passes in quantity through the
fissures and crevices which are generally numerous in the
upper chalk, especially at the bottom of a bed of flints which
in consequence of their impermeability lessen the upward
flow; but flint beds in soft chalk are an advantage, as they
act as drains.</p>

<p class='c000'>The affinity chalk has for water, which has been
considered a reason for the absence of important rivers in
that formation, as water does not flow away freely upon it,
causes it to be readily affected by rain and disintegrated
from the effects of the expansive and contracting action of
frost and thaw; hence draining and covering the surface
may be important, but care must be taken not to interfere
with natural springs. This property of chalk, viz., its
affinity for water, although a disturbing cause in earthwork
in that formation is of value for covering or filling in open
trenches, counterforts, or drains in <em>other</em> soils, as the chalk
attracts water, and therefore dries the surface of other
earths.</p>

<p class='c000'>Anything that localizes the percolation or flow of water,
or helps to make water seams, veins, fissures, and hollows,
which are sometimes filled with sandy gravel, loam, and
detritus readily admitting water, will tend to break the
chalk into separate masses and cause it to become loose and
unstable by the action of rain, frost and thaw, and vibration.
Should flint beds occur in chalk, and they frequently do in
the upper beds if they are horizontal or nearly so, much
more water may be expected to flow along their bed, as it
forms a water-passage, than when they are in inclined or
vertical seams. As chalk absorbs much water, but does
not readily exude it, although it may soon become dry
upon the surface after rain, it is advisable to lessen
percolation in order to prevent slips. It is known that the
angle of friction of water in chalk will affect the flow and
that the discharge varies greatly according to the character,
fracture, and other conditions of the soil; for instance, it has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>been proved that a hydrostatic pressure due to a gradient of
about 1 in 132 is required to enable water to pass through
the chalk as found at Dover, whereas in the Hertfordshire
beds much less is required, namely, that equal to a gradient
of about 1 in 350 to 1 in 420. This is named as showing,
even when unfissured, the varying perviousness and
character of chalk, and that it cannot be treated as a
material of even approximate consistency of texture. The
power of capillary attraction of chalk has been proved to be
great and the evaporation from the surface practically
unlimited. These properties and its known affinity for
water render it liable to constant change; also the particles
of calcareous soils being affected by moisture and to a certain
extent soluble, water will take up lime in them, and therefore
they are treacherous earths and liable to slip and
subside.</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Ansted has shown that a cubic foot of the
upper chalk when dried will absorb 2½ gallons or 40 per
cent. of its bulk of water; the lower chalk 2 gallons, or
33 per cent. of its bulk; and that the pores of a cubic foot of
chalk are equal to 40 per cent. of the bulk, and are therefore
equivalent to the area of a pipe about 9 inches in diameter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ordinary drainage will not remove the water, hence chalk
is a difficult soil to treat successfully, and slips and subsidences
may result in such large areas as the surface of
cuttings and embankments simply through the difficulty of
preventing it becoming saturated.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another characteristic of chalk, which requires careful
observation to prevent slips, is that water does not generally
issue through a mass, or equally over a consider able area, but
is discharged through fissures, and crevices, and flint beds;
hence one of the chief means of preventing slips cannot be
adopted, namely, to disallow a localization of the flow of
any water; therefore, the disturbing element of water seams
is in greater or less degree present in all chalk-earth that is
not solid and homogeneous in texture. The flow from such
water-veins or seams should not be interfered with, as any
obstruction, and possibly diversion, which is likely to fail,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>will only result in the spring saturating the adjacent soil,
and in its bursting out at another place. There is no safe
remedy but to gently lead away the water, for where springs
occur, either in chalk or rock, they will find the line of least
resistance; consequently the waters of percolation will tend
to flow to one place, and cause a spring.</p>

<p class='c000'>Chalk is found in regularly stratified and separated masses,
sometimes caused by beds of flints, and although the position
of the layers may indicate their successive ages, age can
hardly be taken as an absolute indication of the increased
stability of chalk in earthwork. When overlaid with clay
it is usually harder than when bare, probably owing to
pressure, non-exposure to atmospheric influences, and to
the absorbed water being of a different character, which has
been proved by analyses. It is especially advisable in chalk
soils to know the head level of water in the district, and to
note if the bottom of a cutting is below the usual water-bearing
line in the open wells, which may not necessarily
be at the same depth; their average level being ascertained,
an idea can be formed of the probability of springs bursting
out, and according as the rainfall is excessive or not, so
usually will be the flow.</p>

<p class='c000'>If chalk beds incline across a valley, and have an impervious
stratum of clay upon them, it has been found that
the most water issues at or about the point where the impervious
seam first overlies the chalk, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>, at the edge of the
basin, and the greater its depth, the less the flow; therefore,
should a cutting be located at a place where this stratum is
thinnest, more water from springs may be expected than at
any point where the impervious layer is thicker.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is also well to remember that the line of water-flow is
not necessarily a horizontal plane, for it frequently follows
the contour of the chalk, and that the causes of surface
irregularities of subterranean water are unknown; but rain-water
accumulating in chalk principally rises and issues
most rapidly along the bed lines; consequently the flow
along these must be gently discharged, or slips will occur;
but chalk uniform in character and of solid and close texture,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>without flints and fissures, usually is not water-bearing, and
will stand almost vertically. As a rule the cohesion of the
upper beds, if they are homogeneous, is greater than the
lower beds, although the mass may be softer.</p>

<p class='c000'>Should the drainage or natural outlet of the land waters
of a chalk district be obstructed or dammed back, from the
quantity of water being in excess of that the fissures or
water seams in a chalk hill can discharge, and the pent up
waters be unable to escape, hydrostatic pressure, in addition
to a weakened condition of the chalk through excess of
moisture, will be caused, and extensive slips may be expected
along the escarpment, the displacement being gradual, the
ground separating and fissuring until at length it is pushed
out by hydrostatic pressure. Such a slip usually occurs in
large masses, resembling a fallen cliff, for the disturbing
agent is all-powerful, and the area affected very considerable,
and particularly so if the chalk is superimposed upon different
soil, or harder ground, as then the whole mass will probably
move forward.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although some approximate inclinations have been
previously given, the varieties of chalk are so numerous
that no absolute slopes of repose can be named, for chalk
or calcareous earth may be:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Marble or crystalline limestone.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ordinary limestone rock.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hard, compact chalk rock.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lower white chalk.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upper white chalk.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hard grey chalk.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ordinary grey chalk.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pure white chalk.</p>

<p class='c000'>Friable white chalk.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yellow, light and dark blue, soft chalk becoming of
marly character.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hard chalk marl.</p>

<p class='c000'>Grey marly chalk.</p>

<p class='c000'>Grey clayey chalk.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—The preceding chalk marls contain so large a
proportion of argillaceous matter as to become almost clays
so far as regards treatment in earthworks. Many serious
slips have occurred in chalk soils, and their history indicates
that the chief disturbing element was water, whether held
back over a large surface until the hydrostatic pressure
became too great for the slopes to withstand it, or from its
bursting out in springs, and so separating and disintegrating
masses of the earth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Near the entrances to tunnels slips appear to be most
frequent in cuttings in chalk. This would seem to lead to
the belief that in places where it is known the chalk soil
is likely to be troublesome from land-water and springs, it
would be advantageous to prolong tunnels beyond the
economic depth of a cutting, and even to continue them until
such a depth as 40 feet is reached, to so arrange the gradients
that they drain the interior, and to provide a complete system
of pipes and drains, even if side galleries have to be driven
to tap the water, before it reaches the lining, to relieve the
sides, crown, and invert of a tunnel so that no water can
pour down the roof or walls unless under control.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a tunnel so situated and liable to water-pressure, the
thrust of the soil will be very variable, and cannot be foreseen.
At one place during construction, the walls and lining
may be finished without movement of the earth, at another,
the pressure maybe great and act unequally, either upon the
side walls or the arch. As a rule, at the entrances to tunnels
the pressure is greater upon the arch than the sides, for then
the whole of the wedge-shaped mass within the boundary of
the angle of repose of the soil is disturbed, and its cohesion
impaired or destroyed, and therefore it presses upon the arch,
this pressure tending to counteract the lateral pressure; but
as the depth increases, the load from this wedged-shaped mass
becomes less upon the arch, although generally greater than
any lateral pressure, because the earth above is not disturbed
or impaired, consequent upon the depth of the hill being
greater and the cohesion and side-pressure of the earth
tending to support it, but the lateral pressure is increased
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>because the normal pressure of the soil due to the depth is
augmented. It is this disturbance of such friable soil as
chalk at tunnel entrances, causing the particles to be loose
and separated, and in a state especially disposed to percolation
of water, that probably causes the earth to be in a condition
favourable to slips, and for them particularly to occur at or
about the entrances to tunnels. When, therefore, the depth
of open cutting at the entrances is reduced, any slip cannot
be of the same magnitude as it would be if it happened at a
greater depth. The circular or one closely approaching it
would appear to be the best form for the lining, where
variable or great pressure, vertical or lateral, is to be expected;
for the pressure in a tunnel will always be unequal,
and the surface of the earth must be supported.</p>

<p class='c000'>In some experiments to join substances by pressure it was
found that though great pressure forms chalk into hard
blocks, the particles are not firmly united, and that they
separate along the surfaces of contact of the original particles
and not through them; these tests tend to show that masses
of chalk are usually in a state not indisposed to separation.
The same result occurred in similarly testing pulverised
sandstone.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><span class='sc'>Sand and Gravel.</span></h3>

<p class='c016'>In fine sand-cuttings springs may be expected, and the
earth become in a semi-fluid state if there is water at a
higher level to filter through it; also in the case of all
porous and open soils. Any drawing away of the sand
must be prevented, as it will induce a slip, and cause the
earth to become running sand, especially dangerous near
buildings, for its egress must be prevented, or subsidence
will ensue, and serious erosion. The excavation in such
cases should be in as short lengths as practicable, so that
the surfaces are not unsupported, and walls and structures
should be quickly erected. The sands that are met with
in estuaries are frequently in such a condition, that a slight
obstruction to the tidal flow will cause movement, the equilibrium
being easily destroyed. Should there be a break
in the continuity of a clay stratum, overlying light loose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>soil, the latter will probably boil up, and in determining the
depth of a cutting, care should be taken that this impervious
stratum is not broken or injured.</p>

<p class='c000'>Marl, clay and sand beds are likely to slip when they are
superimposed, and there are some districts in which sandy
soil is so charged with water that, unless the drainage of the
slopes and formation suffices to drain for some distance the
land outside a cutting, the sand will become overcharged
with moisture and will act as a fluid and slip, the lateral
support being removed by the act of excavation and its
normal condition altered. Being so delicately balanced the
least additional disturbing force, such as a spoil bank being
tipped upon the surface, or the inducement or acceleration
of a flow of water, will set it in motion and make it a quicksand.
For instance, small sand islands have been removed
by making cuts in them from 15 to 20 feet in width, and by
men shaking bars, &amp;c., inserted in the soil; the sand along
the edge becomes loose, falls, and the current sweeps it away.
As an example of the changeability of the condition of sand
may be named that in sinking pits by congelation in loose
sand it has been found that the grains during the freezing
of the water, by means of tubes containing a freezing mixture,
were additionally separated about 5 to 7 per centum.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the sand met with in public works is seldom in very
deep beds, it has not been subject to the steadying forces
which many earths have undergone, and it may have been
constantly moving until its final deposition, and therefore
it is easily set in motion; and although sand will subside
less from a load after it is saturated with moisture, the
water in it trying to escape may cause it to slip upon an
unsupported surface such as a slope.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many experiments have shown that the power of absorption
of sand decreases with the fineness of the grain, and that sand
when thoroughly wet will contain water equal to about one-third
to two-fifths of its bulk, and that almost all this can
be drained; hence its varying condition and instability. If a
well be sunk in sandstone and regularly pumped it will drain
the rock around for some distance, the drainage space being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>conical, its vertex the bottom of the well, and its base the
surface, varying in extent according to the nature of the soil
and depth of well, showing the porous nature of sand.</p>

<p class='c000'>The interstices of silicious sea-sand, when not compressed,
have been ascertained by Mr. J. Watt Sandeman, M. Inst.
C.E., to amount to about 40 per cent. of the volume of sand.
For coarse or fine sand, or a mixture of the two, the interstices
did not vary much. When it was compressed by a rammer
in water, its bulk could be reduced to the extent of 12½ per
cent. The interstices of broken red sandstone, varying in
size to that which would pass through an 8-inch ring, were
found to be 36 per cent. of the whole volume, but as the
stones were in contact 10 per cent, must be added, and if
under water 15 per cent.</p>

<p class='c000'>The experiments clearly show the known great capability
of subsidence in sandy and open sandy gravel soils, their
clear water space, and how easily fine sand may, by a current
of water, become running sand, and their adaptability for
ramming and consolidation by moisture. Tipped sand
when rammed will subside if saturated with water nearly
as much as it can be beaten down, which shows how greatly
its bulk is affected by water, and although its rapid consolidation
is an advantage in embankments, it is of importance
that percolation should be equal.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chief conditions of a safe foundation upon pure sand,
namely, that it cannot escape laterally or be undermined,
are obviously not to be attained in either cuttings or embankments,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>as the lateral support is removed, and the slopes are
liable to be undermined and unequally charged with water,
and the influence of water on sandy soils is the principal
cause of their instability, for in excavating cuttings the face
will frequently stand at a very steep slope if dry, but upon
its becoming saturated the sand may flow, and in the case of
gravel and sand, although the stones forming gravel do not
change, the whole subsides.</p>

<p class='c000'>As gravel is found in various conditions, it may be well to
classify it as it is herein regarded.</p>

<p class='c000'>Clean gravel is considered as that which nearly approaches
the condition of a pebbly beach. If an appreciable quantity
of sand is present, it is sandy gravel. If loam, or marl, or
clay, it is loamy, marly, or clayey gravel.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gravel hills are large accumulations of water-worn rocks,
and may have boulders in them intermixed with the freshwater
deposits of sands and marls, and by means of natural
cementing material between the particles seem to be firmly
set and to be so conglomerated as to appear to be in a similar
condition to weak concrete; but there is always a chance of
the matrix becoming dissolved, therefore it is advisable to
test a mass by the application of water and to expose it to
the atmosphere before relying upon its permanent stability,
and with the view to determine whether it is hard cemented
gravel or not.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gravel may be made more compact and will subside if
water is pumped upon it and allowed to filter through, and
in making an artificial foundation of gravel, it is not reliable
without water percolation and consolidation by ramming.</p>

<p class='c000'>All earth consisting of particles having rounded surfaces is
liable to become loose, and upon weight being placed upon it
the grains are inclined to roll and become detached, but if
they are angular fragments, which seldom is the case, this
tendency will be lessened, and the angle of repose will be
steeper.</p>

<p class='c000'>With regard to the slopes necessary in sand and gravel,
the more angular, rough, hard, and clean the particles, the
steeper the inclination.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Earth that can be properly called gravel seldom requires a
flatter slope than 1½ to 1, and usually a less inclination is
sufficient, but if loose it will not stand vertically even for a
depth of a few feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>Solid indurated masses of gravel will stand perpendicularly
and as rock.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the gravel consists of quartz or sandstone boulders, or
is very coarse with stones of considerable size, or like a clean
pebbly beach, 1 to 1 <span class='fss'>TO</span> 1¼ to 1.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ordinary clean gravel of uniform size at about 1 to 1.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thoroughly compressed, hard, clean sand, about 1 to 1.</p>

<p class='c000'>Looser sand and light gravel, 1¼ to 1 <span class='fss'>TO</span> 1½ to 1.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sand mixed with vegetable matter, argillaceous or loamy
sand, about 1½ to 1.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the proportion of mould or clay in the sand becomes
greater a flatter slope is necessary according to the nature
of the earth with which it is incorporated, the degree of wetness,
and also the exposure of the surface.</p>

<p class='c000'>Clay loams require slopes from 1½ to 1 <span class='fss'>TO</span> 3 to 1, and
shifting sand when a current of water reaches it will become
a quicksand, and not be stable even when horizontal, but if
drained and the toe is secured it will usually stand at an
inclination of from 3 to 1 <span class='fss'>TO</span> 4 to 1. On the other hand, an
embankment of hard, clean, angular sand, rammed but left
bare, when exposed to tidal action with little wave
disturbance, has reposed at 2 to 1 <span class='fss'>TO</span> 2½ to 1 slopes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Loamy soil and vegetable mould will, for any height not
exceeding about 5 feet, stand nearly vertically for a reasonable
time.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><span class='sc'>Clay.</span></h3>

<p class='c016'>With respect to cuttings and embankments in clay soils,
perhaps no earth is more affected by water and air, or more
difficult to treat, as it will expand if only exposed to the
atmosphere and without contact with water, 6 inches being
no unusual dimension to allow for expansion in tunnel-work.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>This property and its contraction upon drying alone
make it an earth particularly liable to slip and induce
fissures and cracks through which water can trickle, notwithstanding
the surface of the clay may be almost
impermeable. If clay could always be kept dry or in its
natural condition it would be stable and free from slips;
but this cannot be effected, for water is held in suspension in
clay for a considerable period, its plastic nature preventing
gravitation, and evaporation is known to be a very slow
process; and as the same clay under different circumstances
may stand nearly vertically or only at a very flat slope, its
liability to constant change makes it very treacherous, and
it should be classed as a most deceptive earth of a
dangerously unstable and unsafe description, for it may be so
hard as to nearly turn a pick, and yet water and air will
rapidly cause its disintegration, but if weather influences
can be prevented from reaching it when in such a hard
compact state it will afford a firm foundation.</p>

<p class='c000'>London clay in its natural condition usually contains
about 10 per cent. of water. The more permeable the clay
the more likely are slips to occur and the face to become soft,
loose and disintegrated, slimy beds being thus produced
which are difficult to prevent or remove; therefore a covering
of close grass turf, or layer of burnt ballast, ashes, or chalk,
upon any damp place or fissure after it has been filled is
advantageous.</p>

<p class='c000'>Solid blue clay, which generally requires the use of the
pick, of the clays is, perhaps, the most stable, being almost
impermeable if free from delaceration; but yellow and most
other clays are unequal in texture, faults and breaks are
frequently numerous, and water penetrating converts the
surfaces and the mass into a muddy and semi-fluid condition
resting only when horizontal, which has been painfully
experienced in the crushing in, during construction, of some
tunnels in the London district. The trickling of water
down fissures forms a slimy and easy-sliding surface most
difficult to treat or prevent, and so long as the natural
contour of the ground does not offer resistance to movement,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>a slip may extend for a long distance, either in deep or
shallow cuttings, and there may be considerable hydrostatic
pressure.</p>

<p class='c000'>The disruptions, variableness of character, and existence of
fissures cause any but the most homogeneous clays to be
treacherous and likely to slip, particularly the yellow and
any laminated clays, as they allow water to enter by the
veins which are usually frequent in the mass. Yellow clay
has a greater tendency to crack upon drying than blue clay
and does so much more quickly, hence its dangerous nature,
and although a mass may be only damp, fissures will enable
water to penetrate and reduce it to a state of instability; it
is also not infrequently in a plastic state, having fissures and
cavities full of water.</p>

<p class='c000'>It should, however, not be forgotten that in the endeavour
to prevent the deleterious effects of aqueous action upon clay
soils that they may be over-drained, so that they become too
dry, as then the clay will shrink, crack, and fissure; the
chief aim should be to keep it always in a sufficiently moist
state so as to obviate the formation of cracks and fissures, and
at the same time cause it to be dry enough to be firm, and
never in a pasty or pulpy condition; in other words, to
maintain its natural state if one of stability, and prevent any
excess of water penetrating it or reaching its surface.</p>

<p class='c000'>The lias clays are treacherous chiefly owing to the presence
of much calcareous matter, and therefore approach a marly
state; heavy slips have occurred in the has formation in the
midland counties of England, notwithstanding that a slope
was adopted which experience had shown produced stability,
namely 3 to 1. A slight variation in the composition of this
soil or an unfavourable position will cause a slip in such
treacherous earth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pure clay shrinks some 5 per cent. in drying, the contraction
being less as sand is present in it, for when it is
mixed with twice its weight of sand it is reduced to 3 per
cent., and as impurities increase in clays the less impervious
they become. Most clays have silicious earth in them, but
if sand is present the clay is then more open, and water will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>permeate and drain more freely; but mixtures of clay and sand
may assume a pulpy condition when impregnated with water,
consequently it is always advisable to test such earth. The
varieties of sandy clay are many, and all are usually more
or less unstable. Among them may be named red clay with
sand and mica, blue sandy clay, sandy green clay, stiff red
sandy clay, the loamy clays of various hues, dark grey, red
sandy, and black clayey loams.</p>

<p class='c000'>If clay could be kept in a moist state fissures would seldom
occur. The constant alternation of wetness and dryness
creates the fissures, and water completes the disintegration.
There are a few clays which are stable when kept in solid
masses, as then only a small surface is affected by air and
water, but if they are loosened and broken up, as in the
process of excavation and deposition, they readily become in
a muddy condition. Any mud or silt which may be soft and
readily pressed when wet, but cakes and shrinks in to
detached lumps when dry or upon being exposed to the
atmosphere, is a treacherous soil, as it will return to its
original state upon becoming wet. Clays or any soils that
cake should always be regarded with suspicion, as although
having the appearance of solidity and the possession of
weather-resisting qualities in their natural position, when
disturbed, quickly become worthless for earthwork purposes,
and may stand in one situation almost as a soft clay, and
when disturbed and wet assume a horizontal surface. Such
ground may repose at a 4 to 1 <span class='fss'>TO</span> 8 to 1 slope, because its
crust has become caked or case-hardened, yet when it is
broken it may become, upon being exposed, simply fluid
mud. To prevent clay soil weathering upon the surface, a
layer of gravel 1 foot or so in thickness has been placed
upon it, the idea being that it is not only a protection, but
the weight of the covering upon the clay will cause the
water to be pressed out from the soil into the gravel through
which it can percolate to the drains.</p>

<p class='c000'>A crude test to indicate the probable character of a clay as
regards its stability in earthwork is to burn a piece of it and
notice the colour. If it becomes white or of a whitish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>tint, the clay is generally less likely to slip than when it is
of a reddish or yellowish tinge. Another rough experiment
can also be made. Get a piece of clay, place it in water, and
note the time taken and the depth to which the surface has
become saturated, and whether it is very slimy and will
easily slide down a slightly inclined plane; its tenacity
may then be approximately judged. Also by weighing, an
idea of the amount of sand may be imagined; the more sand
there is in clay the lighter it will be, all other conditions
being identical. A comparison between two clays will
enable some opinion to be formed of their relative stability
in earthwork, though, of course, there are many other
features to be considered. All impure clays, such as shaly
clay, sandy clay, loamy clay, and marly clay require to be
carefully treated, although they may be easier to manage
than yellow or brown clay.</p>

<p class='c000'>When two retentive clay beds overlap or overlie, and have
no intermediate permeable stratum, they must be in a humid
state, as is the case in the Fen country, unless they are
constantly drained; but serious slips are not so likely to occur
in them as when two masses of clay have an interposing
seam of sand or silt liable to be eroded by water falling down
fissures in the clay, which probably extend to considerable
depths, with the result that two slimy surfaces are formed
and the clay slides. Clay underlying gravel often contains
numerous pockets and seams filled with running sand, and
should there be a permanent head of water the discharge
will be in large quantities and at a considerable velocity. A
cutting in wet sandy clay is generally treacherous and
difficult to manage.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a clay bed near the surface of the ground is sometimes
upheaved, if a permeable stratum such as gravel or sand
overlies it, the drainage of water through or down the slopes
will be arrested, and the earth at the back of the slope will be
constantly wet and may ultimately become saturated through
the damming back of the water; then a slip may be expected.</p>

<p class='c000'>All upheaved, dislocated, and twisted superficial beds of
clay, which will generally be of varying consistency and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>therefore settle unequally; over or underlying seams of sand
or gravel, are likely to slip and subside, and their stability
much depends upon whether or not the lie of the beds
obstructs the permeation of water. If the dip of the clay-beds
is towards the natural outfall, most probably an
adjacent river, slips are probable because of the creation of
sliding surfaces and the continuity of the beds being
destroyed by a cutting and the consequent loss of support.</p>

<p class='c000'>Should permeable soil lie between the top stratum and a
bed of clay, water will accumulate upon the clay, make it
slimy and cause a flow upon the bed; for example, when a
thin bed of vegetable earth rests upon gravel, sand, or peat,
and that upon clay, water will percolate, and perhaps air,
through the top soils, and may cause them to slip upon the
clay-bed. Also should a layer of clay overlie permeable
strata, as clay upon sand, or clay upon gravel, unless it is
sufficiently thick and solid to prevent infiltration, it may
slide upon the permeable soil as its lower surface becomes
wet. When clay-hills have veins, water may accumulate in
them and flow, and if very dark yellow clay overlies light
yellow calcareous clay, which may rest upon hard blue clay,
it is obvious each stratum is somewhat differently affected
by weather and air, and therefore movement is to be
expected. The edges of clay-hills are always likely to slip,
especially should they be in the form of spurs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Boulder-clay is seldom reliable, because, although it may
be hard and stand vertically in dry weather, in wet it
swells, weathers quickly, becomes soft and cakes upon
drying. The stability of such soil is governed not only by
the nature of the clay, but by that of the boulders and
their effect upon the earth in which they are embedded, and
much depends upon the degree of changeableness upon
exposure to air and moisture of all the particles of which
they are composed; hence boulder-clay, although hard to
excavate, may quickly dissolve. On the contrary, it may
occasionally be so hard that it seems to be solid rock, and
may even resist erosion and weathering as well as if it were
rock; but care must be taken to prevent indurated mud being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>mistaken for solid clay-rock, and therefore it is advisable to
test the soil with water.</p>

<p class='c000'>Seams of silt, soft pasty soil, or soapy earth met with in clay,
which have become decomposed by atmospheric and aqueous
action, are to be feared, and the brown clay, especially when
soft: red, or dark yellow clays that break into laminæ and
crumble upon exposure to the air, and although tenacious
in the flakes and when fresh-cut are loosely held together
in bulk, often have thin veins of sand in them; and when
water percolates it remains, and is very difficult to drain.
It has also been found that when minute non-adhesive
particles of mica are present in clay that it will become
disintegrated by water, although it may be hard to excavate.
Some of the gault clays, although stable when dry, become
soapy when wet and are not easily managed, but the bluish
grey gault is usually tenacious and almost impermeable.
The gault clays have little sand in them but much
calcareous matter, and, as a rule, they do not swell and bulge
like the London clays.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some clays, when dry, appear to be stable and firm,
though they are often drift or dried-up mud simply requiring
the influence of water and the atmosphere to cause them to
return to their original state; the brown and boulder-clays
are of this nature and are distinctly perishing, and
therefore treacherous clays.</p>

<p class='c000'>As in clay and all retentive soils, water is always present,
and as the impervious nature of clay prevents water
gravitating and being drained, and as owing to wet seasons
the permeable portion of the clay may gradually become
overcharged and be reduced to a muddy condition, slips
may occur years after a clay cutting has been excavated or
an embankment deposited. In clay embankments the
greater weight upon the centre may gradually press water
towards the slopes and cause them to slip; hence the value
of covering the formation in order to lessen percolation.
Cracks and fissures may be so produced in clay embankments,
and the danger is that they form sliding surfaces and
cavities from the presence of water, and gradually soften the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>interior until it fails from the thrust of the earth and want
of uniform support; therefore, clay earths are more difficult
to treat than granular soils, as local weakness is the cause
of failure, a mass may be sound, but a crack or fissure may
soon become large and pass through an embankment to the
seat or the slopes. Although the filtration of still water
may not cause an embankment to slip as long as the water
merely restores it to its normal absorbing power, when that
is exceeded the percolating water will be dammed-up and
cause hydrostatic pressure and a soddened surface, destroy
cohesion, and disintegrate the particles.</p>

<p class='c000'>When clay is contained within the walls of a building,
injurious action and unequal settlement may arise, as the
earth inside and outside may be in a different condition;
consequently in soils that expand and contract there may be
external or internal pressure according to the state of
dampness or dryness, consequent upon the ground outside
being subject to weather influences and the contained earth
being comparatively free from such operation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shale, whether black or brown, may become decomposed
by water and be softened by time, and is either loose or
firm. If loose, it requires protection, and the surface should
not be exposed to the weather. The presence of iron pyrites in
shale has been found to be a cause of its becoming treacherous
when water has access to it, as the mass becomes decomposed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Marly soils are of various hues, red, blue, grey, and
yellow, and consist principally of clay and lime, and are
usually called clay-marls when clay preponderates, and
marl-clays or chalk-marls when chalk is in excess. They
are dry to the touch and will effervesce with acids, the
presence of lime being thus made evident by the ebullition
produced, and some idea of the relative quantity may be
judged by comparing results with different lumps: they
vary in character according as lime or clay predominates.</p>

<p class='c000'>Chalk-marl may act as an almost impermeable stratum
and arrest the percolation of water from more permeable
soil, but it is liable to slip because of fissures being present in
it, which are common to most calcareous earths; and when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>these crevices are bared in cuttings by the ground being
excavated, the flow from the previously-confined or diverted
springs is facilitated, and perhaps the harmless underground
passage of water is prevented, and consequently the
earth may become loosened and unstable owing to the
changed condition.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although marl may be so hard that it cannot be excavated
by picks and bars, but requires blasting, some varieties
crumble and become soft under weather influences, and the
slopes need protection, or a constant trickling and wearing
away of the surface will result. Grey marl generally
weathers quickly, and if there is much clay in it, it often falls
to pieces upon exposure to the air, and becomes broken and
so split into disjointed pieces as to admit water, and as it
sometimes contains a considerable quantity of sand it is soon
reduced to an unstable state, for marl-clay and sand beds are
always likely to slip. The variegated marls are treacherous,
but red marl is usually stable, still it must be lined in tunnels;
and so are those that are impermeable or closely approach
that condition, but any marl in which the lime may separate
from the mass is unstable. All clay or marl soils that soon
work into “slurry” may be classed as treacherous, or any
earth that quickly becomes in a liquid state; for instance,
some of the hard “pan” soil met with in Canada melts
away by the action of air, rain, snow and frost, and becomes
unmanageable and like blue paint, and will quickly fill
drains and run down the slopes and cover the formation of a
cutting. Also the top black cotton soil found in India
expands by aqueous action, and contracts in drying as clay,
and is of doubtful stability.</p>

<p class='c000'>As might be expected, the more argillaceous or clayey
marls when exposed to weather influences expand, contract,
and act almost as clays, becoming decomposed, disjointed and
separated, and when superimposed upon rock, especially if it
be inclined, are very likely to slip, and are treacherous and
unstable soils, as they soon become in a muddy state and have
slimy surfaces, which, when resting upon any dipping bed,
cause them to be disposed to move upon the smallest disturbing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>element being present or becoming increased, such
as water or vibration. When a comparatively permeable
stratum overlies even hard marl, water will penetrate to the
latter earth and the superimposed layer will rest upon an
unstable bed, and therefore be likely to slip. Blue, or any
marl when found mixed with layers of small gravel and
sandy clay is very treacherous, as air and water cause it to
swell and crumble, and it becomes in a soft state requiring a
very flat slope. All clay marls that swell when wet, and
crack and fissure when dry, are unstable, as water percolates
to them, and should sand veins occur in marl, water may
trickle to a considerable depth and cause the ground to be in
a loose and doubtful condition below the formation or bottom
of a cutting. Such soil when tipped into an embankment is
worse to treat than in a cutting, as it will absorb and retain
water so that it is practically impossible to drain or extract it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Ansted has classed clay soils as under:—</p>

<p class='c000'>When combined with 30 or 40 per cent. of sand they are
<span class='fss'>CLAY LOAMS</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>When combined with 40 to 70 per cent. of sand they are
<span class='fss'>TRUE LOAMS</span> and <span class='fss'>LOAMY SOILS</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>But not until they have 90 per cent. of sand in them are

<p class='c000'>but from hydrostatic pressure the same clay may require
from 2 to 1 <span class='fss'>TO</span> 3 to 1 slopes in cuttings, and even an
inclination of 5 to 1 has been found to be necessary.</p>

<p class='c000'>The varying slope-system is referred to in Chapter VI., as
also the range of slopes.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>It is always well to bear in mind that in the case of clay,
loamy or marly soils, or any possessing soluble particles, the
quantity of water in them governs the required flatness of
the slope, and as it may be variable, a clay that will repose
at a certain angle may slip upon receiving an additional
amount of water, hence the importance of drainage and
protection. The cohesive strength of clay also varies
greatly; and as it is likely to be impaired, and, perhaps,
destroyed by water and other causes, it should be considered
as of fluctuating value, and therefore as generally
unreliable.</p>

<p class='c000'>The slopes of repose required in river-banks have a wide
range according to the degree of exposure and opposition to
the free flow of water, and the protection given to the
surface. In canals, and drainage-channels, or ordinary
rivers, they range from 1½ to 1, when protected, to 5 to 1;
but there are numerous small, shallow, and sluggish streams
with almost vertical banks. As the earth of river-banks is
frequently of a clayey nature the slopes are referred to under
the head of Clay; usually it is mixed in character, and,
therefore, the slope of stability cannot be determined from
that of any particular and unalloyed soil. Towards the
mouth the land often consists of detritus liable to be washed
away by a stronger flood than that by which it was
deposited; it may also be eroded by constant or increased
wave action. Ordinary clayey, loamy, tenacious, or not
easily moved, silt and sand river-banks, in a current that
will not erode them at moderate depths, if the face is protected,
will stand at an inclination of about 1½ to 1, when
the channel is freshly cut.</p>

<p class='c000'>If not covered or protected at from 2 to 1 <span class='fss'>TO</span> 3 to 1, but
when in clay soil of a doubtful character and non-homogeneous,
or boulder-clay, about 4 to 1.</p>

<p class='c000'>2 to 1 <span class='fss'>TO</span> 3 to 1 is the most general slope; but in marsh
land, unless the surface is protected, they may not permanently
stand at 5 to 1. Fascine-work may be the easiest
and most convenient protection, or a gravel or turf-covering
may suffice, and should new channels have to be created, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>question to decide is, will it be cheaper to make the slopes
sufficiently flat so that they can be left unprotected, or is it
preferable to have a steep inclination, such as 1½ to 1, and to
carefully cover and protect the surfaces, the probable cost of
maintenance of the protecting cover being duly considered?</p>

<p class='c000'>As a rule in homogeneous earth, such as clay, underground
excavation is the most free from water, and therefore from
slips; but the enormous force clay possesses upon swelling—and
this disturbance of the soil may occur many times by
the action of air and moisture—and its contraction upon
drying, cause tunnels in clay to be risky undertakings.
The chief precautions against failure are to allow plenty of
space for the expansion of the clay, reduce the uncovered
lengths to the least dimensions, have dry, yet hard and compressible,
filling between the arch and the walls and the
clay, use the strongest bricks, or material with great compressive
strength for the lining, adopt a form giving as
equal support as possible in every direction, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>, one closely
approaching the circular, leave plenty of weep-holes to
prevent any accumulation of water, and thoroughly drain
and gently conduct to the proper drainage channels all water
as it exudes.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>The General Effect of a Slip in a Cutting or an Embankment.—Enumeration
and Consideration of some Protective and Remedial
Works.—Treatment of the Slipped Earth.</span></p>

<p class='c005'>With regard to the effect of a slip the chief consideration is,
will it be dangerous and prevent traffic or the unrestrained
use of the work? A problem most difficult to solve. Upon
railways experience seems to show that slips of earthwork in
cuttings of a depth exceeding about 10 to 15 feet are more to
be feared as likely to interfere and stop the traffic than slips
in embankments, and particularly as, except on sidelong
ground, slips in embankments seldom occur in which the
whole of the formation is moved, or becomes too unstable for
a slow train to pass over, and a temporary road can usually
be maintained by timber trestles and baulks, or other usual
means. When a slip happens in a cutting the fallen earth
may cover the formation, and it is certain that it can move
in no other direction. The permanent way may be entirely
buried, and it may be undesirable to excavate the slipped
earth until other remedial works have been completed, and
therefore the traffic is stopped until they are effected. In
cuttings of little depth where a 3 or 4 to 1 slope assumed by a
cutting originally excavated to, say, 1½ to 1 slopes, will not
touch the ballast, the serious consequences of a slip are reduced
to a minimum, and may not interfere with the traffic, and can
be remedied by the road-men on the section; but not so in the
case of embankments. Consequently the depth of a cutting or
height of an embankment must be regarded as a governing
condition apart from other considerations hereinafter named.</p>

<p class='c000'>The height or depth at which a slip in an embankment or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>cutting becomes disastrous cannot be ascertained by any
rule, but knowledge of the flattest slope at which any
particular earth has remained stable in the same state as the
embankment or cutting under deliberation, will enable a
close approximation to be determined of the point to which
a slip in a cutting is likely to reach, and that to which
an embankment will subside. For instance, a cutting 15
feet in depth, having originally slopes of 1½ to 1, can assume
practically 2 to 1 slopes without covering the rails, and,
similarly, a 10-feet cutting, a slightly flatter inclination
than 2 to 1. Taking into consideration that for some little
depth from the surface a cutting, except in loose or
treacherous soil, will stand at a steeper slope than 2 to 1,
perhaps, on the whole, apart from the formation of proper
water-tables, an engineer is not justified in making
expensive provision in cuttings, even in doubtful soil,
unless upon an inclined bed towards the cutting, of a less
depth than from 10 to 15 feet, as they can be more
economically remedied after they occur, and meteorological
influences have shown the location of the unstable portion.
Nevertheless heavy slips have taken place even in cuttings
of such a moderate depth as about 10 feet, particularly in
clay earths, and it has been necessary to entirely suspend
the traffic consequent upon a continuous mass of earth of
shallow depth moving forward upon an unguentous stratum
slightly inclined towards the formation, and completely
blocking up the cutting; but this was an exceptional case.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are many cuttings in all parts of the world under
very different conditions of weather and climate, and in
every conceivable variety of earth, in which nothing has
been done to prevent movement, with the exception,
perhaps, of a surface-drain inside the fence and a water-table,
self-formed or otherwise, near the foot of the slope;
and there are many cuttings and embankments without any
precautionary works. Nevertheless they stand or require
but little attention. This fact naturally leads to the
question: when ought any works to be executed with the
view of preventing movement in earthwork? Expenditure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>in precautionary and preservative works, where they are not
required, and the serious consequences of a slip are reduced
to a minimum, cannot be defended; nor can the absence of
such preventive measures in treacherous earth or soil so
placed as to induce instability, and where the effect of a slip
may be temporarily or permanently disastrous, notwithstanding
that economy in construction has now become the
watch-word of railway-extension; as then the expense of
restoration and maintenance will be very considerably
increased and far exceed the comparatively small cost of
initial protection, for public traffic may be stopped and
injury caused to life and property.</p>

<p class='c000'>The preceding and the following pages have been written
in the hope that they may afford some assistance in arriving
at a correct decision, with regard to the necessity of precautionary
works, and with the view of calling to remembrance
many of the principal points to be considered in
order to remedy slips, a matter usually demanding prompt
decision. With respect to the measures that should be
adopted to prevent slips, and the works required when
they have occurred, it would be a mistake to generalize
from any successful application of one method of reparation,
as it is necessary to consider each soil separately, and to
discover the reason of a slip; for an attempt to arrest the
forward movement of a large mass will be futile; the disturbing
cause must be ascertained and removed, or so lessened
and controlled as to obviate further motion or deterioration;
sand or porous strata, which may emit water uniformly, must
be treated differently to earth which sets free water in a
particular place, as also the same soil if it should be in a
dissimilar condition. The object of all such works is to
support, maintain, and drain the earth and prevent any
accumulation of water in the slopes and formation, so that
movement is improbable; therefore, water flowing towards
the slopes must be intercepted and led away before it has
time to percolate; and the method of discharging it must
be governed by the position and nature of the soil, the chief
aim of draining operations being to cause the earth to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>always in its most consolidated condition. Without obstruction
to the drainage, a general preservative is to cover the
surface, and protect it against the deleterious effects of rain,
frost and thaw, particularly in the case of soils which
disintegrate rapidly under the influence of weather.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the means that can be adopted to prevent slips
and subsidences in cuttings and embankments may be
enumerated as follows.</p>

<p class='c000'>1. Systematic drainage of a cutting, and the natural
ground and deposited earth in an embankment, so as to
augment its weight sustaining power and general stability.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. A side ditch near to the foot of each slope, and at the
top of the slope adjacent to the fence line.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. Catchwater drains upon the slopes.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. Wells, filled with broken filtering material, contiguous
to the fence line and connecting drains with them.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. Open timber trenches, strutted at intervals, and acting
as drains and counterforts, at the toe of a slope.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. A channel for the discharge of any water issuing from
an intercepted field drain.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. Tapping springs in the slopes or formation of a cutting,
or that exist in the ground upon which an embankment has
to be deposited.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. The profile of the formation being made higher in the
centre, so that water will flow into the side drains or water-table
and not remain, due provision being made for its
discharge.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. Side drains being made before the excavation is commenced
or deposited.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. No accumulation of water being allowed upon the
ground upon which an embankment has to be deposited.</p>

<p class='c000'>11. Covering a slope with rammed earth, burnt ballast,
chalk, gravel, ashes, or other protective material.</p>

<p class='c000'>12. Turfing a slope, or sowing it with grass seed.</p>

<p class='c000'>13. Depositing layers of material, consolidated by ramming
or otherwise, upon a slope at right angles or diagonally to
the line of the foot of a slope.</p>

<p class='c000'>14. By benching, or a terrace or cess upon a slope.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>15. Covering the toe of a slope with stone pitching.</p>

<p class='c000'>16. Dividing a slope by trenches filled with stones or
absorbent material.</p>

<p class='c000'>17. Weighting a slope to counteract the pressure of the
internal water, and to restore the equilibrium.</p>

<p class='c000'>18. A breast-high retaining wall at the toe of a slope.</p>

<p class='c000'>19. Covering part or the whole of a slope with fascine
mattresses or brushwood, systematically laid in combination
with gravel, stone, broken bricks, ashes, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'>20. Counterforts of gravel, chalk, burnt ballast, ashes,
rubble, &amp;c., at the toe and upon a slope.</p>

<p class='c000'>21. A dry wall at the toe of the slope of a stratum of
unstable soil, found above the formation level and superimposed
upon rock or firm earth.</p>

<p class='c000'>22. Varying or increasing the flatness of a slope towards
the bottom of a cutting or embankment.</p>

<p class='c000'>23. In cuttings, by retaining walls, with or without overhead
struts.</p>

<p class='c000'>24. Systematic planting upon the cess and slopes, trees,
shrubs, or bushes having deep wide-spreading roots.</p>

<p class='c000'>25. The removal of any spoil bank that may have been
tipped or cast out near the top of the slope of a cutting.</p>

<p class='c000'>26. Removing the turf and all loose or decaying matter
from the natural ground before the earth is deposited.</p>

<p class='c000'>27. Clearing away all snow and frozen soil before tipping
or excavating, and taking care that no frozen earth is
deposited.</p>

<p class='c000'>28. Forming the ground upon which an embankment has
to be tipped, at an inclination downward from the toe of a
slope, towards the centre, and the construction of a dry drain
along the centre line so as to cause percolating water to flow
away, or prevent it reaching the slopes.</p>

<p class='c000'>29. Benching the ground upon which an embankment has
to be deposited.</p>

<p class='c000'>30. Covering the ground upon which an embankment is
to be tipped with a hard permeable layer.</p>

<p class='c000'>31. Trenches filled with stones or other hard permeable
material across the base of an embankment.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>32. Covering the toe of the slope of an embankment with
sods or making a counterfort of turf.</p>

<p class='c000'>33. Running to spoil all saturated earth, and suspending
operations for a day or two after heavy and continuous rain
or a fall of snow, or frost.</p>

<p class='c000'>34. Filling any large fissures as they appear.</p>

<p class='c000'>35. Weighting the earth so as to condense it.</p>

<p class='c000'>36. Increasing the area of the base of an embankment
according to the bearing power of the soil.</p>

<p class='c000'>37. By the exclusion of all boulders, roots, turf, branches
of trees, or bushes in forming an embankment.</p>

<p class='c000'>38. By aiding consolidation and preventing separation at
the junction of two embankments.</p>

<p class='c000'>39. Tipping an embankment in such a way as to promote
consolidation.</p>

<p class='c000'>In subsequent chapters many protective and remedial
measures are specifically named. Here reference is made
to the more general principles. The purpose for which a
cutting has been excavated, or an embankment deposited
must be taken into consideration in providing protective
works, for the surfaces may only be temporarily bared, as in
trenchwork for walls, or be partly covered with water, as in
canals, and entirely unsubmerged upon one side as in canal,
reservoir, and reclamation embankments; or be fully exposed
to meteorological influences as in railway and road cuttings
and embankments. There can be no stereotyped system of
operations for treating a slip, but experience indicates that
a frequently successful initiatory method is to divide the
earth into small portions, and to proceed to equally consolidate
them. However, in the case of deep cuttings, especially
when excavated in the side of a hill, it may be necessary to
drive a heading beneath the formation and to connect it with
a shaft upon the higher side, so as to tap the water-bearing
soil, and to convey the water away to prevent it reaching the
slopes; this may be considered as a slip requiring an exceptional
remedy. Should a cutting be in moving ground
or permeable soil of doubtful stability, such a system of
wells and covered galleries, which are generally successful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>even in the worst soil, may be required. The wells should,
if possible, be sunk a few feet into an impermeable stratum,
their diameter being the least a man can excavate, to any size
required, and their distance apart, say, from 30 to 60 feet,
according to the quantity of water to be collected. They
should be connected by drifts. Smaller intermediate wells
can be made between the main wells. In order to be effectual
such works must be carefully and uniformly constructed, or
an accumulation of water will arise. When a slip is known
to have occurred, simply from want of drainage, a sufficient
remedy may be the removal of the slipped earth and the
insertion of drains. An advantage of the loose counterfort
system of drainage as compared with rigid and fixed drains,
is that open drains will follow a slight subsidence of the
earth, and yet maintain their efficiency, but care must be
taken that they do not become choked. In shifting or
doubtful soil all works should be quickly finished, and in
sidelong ground it is best to commence drainage operations
on the valley side so as to tap the water, as if they are begun
on the hill-side they may, until through drainage is effected,
form channels for the accumulation of water, and cause a
slip. The repairs of a slip can be commenced at several
places simultaneously if at short distances apart, such as
20 feet or so, and, as a rule, it is preferable in an embankment
that the work proceeds towards the centre, and not
from the central portion to the slopes. It is advisable to
make ditches or galleries in short lengths, not only to disturb
the ground as little as possible, but also to ensure perfect
supervision, as if the work is not carefully and uniformly
constructed, localization of water will ensue.</p>

<p class='c000'>The extent of a slip will to some extent govern the remedy.
Simple open stone-filled drains, 2 to 4 feet in width, and 1
foot to 2 feet in depth, extending from the base to the top,
may be sufficient for shallow cuttings or embankments, such
as 10 to 15 feet, and larger and deeper trenches above those
depths or heights, and complete drainage of and around the
slipped earth, and division of it by means of drains and
pipes.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>In countries where there is an excessive rainfall in a short
time, it has been found necessary to catch as much of the
surface flood waters and torrential streams as possible, and
to reduce their velocity before passing through an embankment
or down a cutting, and to provide a pond or “tumbling
bay” at the base of a waterfall for such purpose, or to erect
dams, when the force is not too great, so as to arrest and
lessen the velocity of the flow. Without such precautions,
flood waters will erode the earth, and the beds become
gradually deeper; and walls at the toe, culverts, and dry
stone filling across the whole width of an embankment, and
stone covering upon the slopes where water issues or flows
may be required. Catchment reservoirs have also proved of
use in controlling the surface waters before they reach a
cutting or embankment, and in permitting them to be
controlled.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many of the chief causes of slips in embankments are
enumerated in Chapter I., &amp;c. Some of the most important
operations to prevent slips in an embankment are to
thoroughly drain its seat, prevent a flow upon the surface of
the original ground, percolation of drainage waters into its
lower part and filtration of rain-water at the crown, and to
generally protect the surface.</p>

<p class='c000'>The stability of an embankment is not regulated by the
cohesiveness of the soil, as a sand or gravel embankment, or
that formed of any material whose particles are not deleteriously
affected, will stand with a sufficiently flat slope if
protected against erosion, and be more stable than a clay or
any embankment in which the particles are soluble and soon
impaired by water, however great their original tenacity.
If any part of an embankment has become saturated, the
internal water must be tapped and drained; as the lower
surface portion is almost certain to be the wetter, the drains
should be made at the base, trenches filled with open porous
material upon the slopes, and, perhaps, it may be necessary
to sink a few shallow wells. The slopes and formation
should be covered so that when the excess of moisture is
extracted from the mass it cannot be replaced. Porous earth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>counterforts can be adopted, 6 to 10 feet in width, placed
at intervals depending upon the nature and condition of the
soil and height of an embankment, or a continuous bank of
similar material at the toe to support the embankment
during the temporary weakening from drainage operations.
One of the worst cases that may have to be treated in
embankments is in clay or marl soils, when the central
portion has been first tipped in a wet state in the winter
months, and after an interval the embankment completed
to its required width in a frozen condition, or nearly so, or
one in which the earth becomes frozen when deposited.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Russia it has been found that rain-water percolating
into such an embankment cannot drain away, but accumulates
and finally bursts the slopes, and that water will exude from
frozen soil when it thaws, a considerable time elapsing
before all the frozen earth has thawed; water is thus, as it
were, taken into the mass, which in all retentive soils will
be difficult to drain without turning over the earth; and it
will cause slimy surfaces and general instability. It will
always be an expensive operation to make such an embankment
secure, and it cannot be made as firm as one properly
deposited. After subsidence has ceased, an approved remedy
in such a case is to cover the formation with an impermeable
layer, and to raise the embankment to the rail level with sand,
which is ultimately alone used for repairs, the slopes being
carefully trimmed and sown.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although not considered in the usual acceptation of the
word as a slip, the trickling of the surface soil is mentioned
as it is a movement which may, if allowed to proceed, cause
a slip, and frequently necessitates attention because of the
soil becoming in a liquid condition and flowing upon land
beyond that acquired for any works, and also because it
obstructs and chokes drains. It may be expected when a
thaw occurs after severe frost, or heavy rain succeeds drought,
or subsequent to a rapid change of weather in any earth of a
clayey or calcareous nature, as, for instance, in clay marl
and argillaceous chalk cuttings or embankments, and if the
configuration of the ground should be favourable to its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>passage to land outside that purchased, such issue must be
prevented by protecting the slopes by means of a covering,
by draining, or by the consolidation of the surface of the
earth, which latter operation may be difficult, or by the
erection of a small mound near the fence line.</p>

<p class='c000'>In ground containing salt or other solvents in appreciable
quantity, care should be taken that water does not reach it;
if it should, the soil immediately becomes damaged and
subsides; also it is found that the earth from which soda
nitrate is manufactured in North Chili must be kept perfectly
dry to be secure as a foundation. All soils of a salifiable
character should be considered as likely to subside and slip.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the salt-producing districts in England it is found that
when the brine, which is about 25 per cent. of the mass, is
pumped up to the surface to be made into white salt, the
land will subside, as in effect it is pumping up the underground
supporting stratum or rock salt bed; and when a
river is contiguous or copious springs, the rock-salt will be
supplied with water to make it brine. The experience of
those who have had to maintain embankments in these
districts indicates that so long as subsidence is uniform
embankments can be raised and maintained; but when
water penetrates into an old pit previously comparatively
dry, unequal and dangerous slips and subsidences may be
expected, and on so large a scale as to require much
expenditure for restoration. If the settlement is uniform,
the easiest way is to simply raise an embankment; the rate
of sinking varies considerably, averaging, say, from 2 to
5 feet per annum, and depending upon the amount of
brine extracted and the percolation of water, &amp;c. It is
obvious that embankments upon such land require constant
attention to prevent serious slips.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the edge of a cliff or hill where loose rock exists and is
joined by clayey soil, but is sufficiently stable not to slip in a
mass, it may be necessary to have a cover shed over a
railway or road to prevent detached pieces of rock falling
upon the surface, the slopes from being injured, and larger
masses sloping down. Covering a slope in such a case is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>useless, but an open deep trench, specially constructed to
catch pieces of rock, may suffice.</p>

<p class='c000'>Important questions to determine when a slip has occurred
are:—</p>

<p class='c000'>1. Should the whole or part of the earth that has slipped
be removed?</p>

<p class='c000'>2. How are the voids to be filled that have been caused by
the slip?</p>

<p class='c000'>3. Can the disturbed material be again used?</p>

<p class='c000'>4. What protective measures should be adopted?</p>

<p class='c000'>A thorough examination of the site of a slip and the
slipped earth is absolutely necessary before the most effectual
and economical means of restoration can be determined, for
weakness or the presence of a disturbing agent in the upper or
lower portion of a cutting or embankment may be the cause
of movement. An embankment may be solid in the mass and
only portions may slip and subside, but then may become
unstable and require different treatment, or local restoration
may alone be necessary, and the slipped earth to be removed
be small in quantity. Extensive slips of the whole of an
embankment usually occur from springs in its seat or the
existence of a flow of water upon the ground under the base,
producing a greasy surface. Should it happen that an
embankment of pervious soil is tipped upon impervious
ground having a depression resembling a basin, water will
accumulate until it reaches the level of discharge, and a
serious slip may result. In such a case the slipped earth
must be removed and the water tapped and permanently
drained. The upper portion of an embankment may slip and
the lower be stable; if so, it is not so serious as when movement
commences at the toe and the slope bulges outwards
and the embankment subsides; in the former case, provided
the lower portion is not affected or its drainage obstructed,
it may not be necessary to remove the slipped earth, but it
is advisable to drain it, and any localization or lodgment of
water between the slipped mass and the firm part of an
embankment must be prevented, or the toe of the slope will
be made in an unstable condition.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>In cuttings in order to keep open the formation the whole
of the slipped earth may have to be excavated, but in
embankments, so long as the soil does not extend outside
the fencing, its entire removal becomes optional, and is
unnecessary provided further movement be prevented, and
the soil drained; but in most treacherous earths, although
a slip may be arrested, it will generally be a place requiring
constant watching, and be one of doubtful stability. Earthwork
slips require to be remedied as soon as possible after
they occur, not only to repair them and obviate an
interruption of traffic, but in order that the unslipped
portions may not be deleteriously affected and movement be
induced.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the earth is very soft, silty, and difficult to drain,
the only course may be to remove the slipped material,
although it may not be necessary to excavate all of it, as it
may form a reservoir for the accumulation of water, and is
certain to be liable to disturbance from the effects of
weather; but in firmer soil a portion of the slipped earth
may be excavated, and be rammed in layers inclining at right
angles, or nearly so, to the surface of the slope, and a drain
can be inserted at about the bottom of the line of the slip to
prevent any water that may percolate from the unslipped
mass flowing into the rammed earth or any counterfort so
constructed; but counterforts may afford insufficient support
in very treacherous soil, and it may be necessary to
remove either the whole or a considerable part of a slope and
replace it with the best available material watered and
rammed: however, the simple ramming of the earth and
depositing it in inclined layers may not be sufficient to
ensure stability, and should it be found that the slipped
material is very soft and cannot be readily drained, it must
be excavated, and solid and firm earth put in its place.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the base of a slip is level with the bottom of any
side ditch that may have existed before movement occurred,
the drain should be below the level of the ditch, or a flow of
water may be induced at the seat which will probably cause
further unsettlement; and if a slip extends below the bottom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>of a cutting it is necessary to remove the slipped earth as far
as the solid ground, and to fill the void with dry material of
sufficient weight to prevent the surface being uplifted, and
to cause solidity in order to avoid any movement of the toe
of a slope.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the slipped soil is clay or shale it can be burnt <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in
situ</span></i> down to the solid ground, or upon an incombustible bed,
and be converted into a kind of brick rubbish and then be
restored to its original place; but this may be an expensive
method, and it may be cheaper to procure firm earth, nevertheless,
should no other material be available it may be the
only economical means of repairing a slip. Before deciding
whether clay or shale shall be burned <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in situ</span></i> it may be
advisable to test the amount of ballast that can be made by,
say, 1 ton or more of coal, and the cost including every item
of expenditure: 10 or 12 cubic yards of ballast may be
obtained for every ton of coal burnt, but this quantity may
be so reduced that the cost of burning may prohibit the use
of such a method for replacing the slipped earth when made
into firm soil. It much depends upon the quantity of water
in the material, and also upon the nature of the earth; for
instance, burning becomes more difficult as the amount of
silica in the clay becomes greater, and the ballast is not so
good as the quantity of lime increases in the clay; therefore
pure clay makes the best burnt ballast. Should it be
decided to burn the slipped earth, it is necessary that it
be placed upon firm ground, and that it rests upon an
open layer of stone or material that will not kindle in order
to obtain the necessary draught. The thickness of the
layers must be regulated by the degree of wetness of the
soil, from 1 to 2 feet being required for thorough burning,
and should layers of a less thickness than 1 foot be required,
the process of making the slipped earth into burnt ballast
will usually be too expensive, but of course much depends
upon the price of the coal upon the site. The burnt
ballast may cost anything from 1<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> to 2<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> 6<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">d.</span></i> a cubic
yard; when the latter price is reached, it may be
cheaper to procure sound earth. If the slipped earth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>approaches the condition of carbonaceous shale, black or
dark brown in colour, it may kindle easily; the more argillaceous
shales will require a little coal to convert them to
burnt ballast, the quantity increasing as they gradually
become of a clayey character. Blue clay, when thoroughly
burnt, generally makes better ballast than most other clays,
but as a drain the ballast is not equal to clean gravel.</p>

<p class='c000'>In considering whether it is only necessary to simply
replace the dried earth in its original position, it should be
determined whether the undisturbed portion of an embankment
will support the weight when unaided by counterforts
with a foundation in solid ground at the toe of the slope,
trenches and drains upon the slopes, and perhaps a rough
stone bed below the seat of the slip acting as an open drain
over part or the whole of it. In any case provision must be
made that there is no localization of water between the
original embankment and the filling or the counterfort. In
some soils, particularly those having seams of sand or silt,
the slipped earth frequently becomes displaced in layers, and
if allowed to remain, each bed will form a water seam upon
which any stratum can slide, and then the earth may not be
at rest until the slope is very flat. The removal of the
whole mass is the cheapest remedy. The surface left bare
by the slipped earth should be trimmed, and all fissures
in it be filled so as to prevent any accumulation or lodgment
of water, but the slipped earth should only be excavated in
short lengths, as it may render support and keep part of the
face covered, and it should be remembered that although the
upper portion of the fallen earth may be the drier it may
not be the most stable.</p>

<p class='c000'>The system of removing the slipped earth, erecting rough
rubble walls at intervals of 20 to 30 feet projecting as far
as the face of the original slope, and then filling the
intervening space with the material that has slipped, when
turned over and punned, has been successfully adopted. It
is advisable to cover with turf the replaced earth in the
slope, unless some other protection is supplied. When any
signs of movement afterwards take place a few additional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>counterforts, which, may also be made to act as drains, will
generally restore the equilibrium. This system relies upon
preventing movement in earth by separating the masses of
the slipped soil, and draining and supporting them in detail.
The foundations of the counterforts must be in the solid
ground and not merely below the seat of the slip. It may
be impossible to drain the site of a slip or the soil that has
moved without dividing it into portions, the chief object
being to thoroughly drain the site and the slipped earth, so
that it is practically encircled with drains and any water
prevented from collecting in or upon it.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the land is of little value and a cutting is in a
mountain or hill-side, it may be advisable to assist an extensive
slip, provided it happens before any public works are
opened for traffic; and to remove the earth by loosening it
by the action of a stream of water until it slides away, as
draining or supporting it may be insufficient. Under such
circumstances it is the best course to adopt, especially if a
stream of water can be readily diverted to it as the unstable
soil is finally disengaged.</p>

Cuttings and Embankments in Different Kinds of Earth and
under Diverse Conditions.—The Construction of Culverts,
Pipe-drains, Trenches, Ditches, and Catchwater Drains.</span></p>

<p class='c005'>With respect to the percolation and drainage of water in
cuttings and embankments, in cuttings the chief consideration
is to gently extract and conduct the water so as to
avoid any accumulation or localised flow beneath the
original surface of the ground in order to prevent the surface
water eroding the slopes or collecting or forming a course,
saturating the ground outside them, and to ensure that the
earth is not more charged with water than when in its
normal condition; for, as soon as the state of absorption has
reached that of dissolving or separating the particles, however
fine, aqueous action is likely to produce slips, and a flow
of water or vibration will supply the disturbing force
necessary to commence a movement. In embankments one
of the chief precautions is to obviate any flow of water upon or
at a few feet beneath the land upon which an embankment
has to be deposited, as it will disturb the feet of the slopes
and the base, reduce the adhesion to and the friction of the
tipped earth upon the ground and form a sliding surface.</p>

<p class='c000'>An accumulation of water upon the formation must be
prevented, and, as in the majority of cases a railway or road
is not level, any collection of water at the commencement of
an incline or at a change of gradient should be provided
against, and especially any localisation of flow down the
slopes from the formation; the main point being to keep a
cutting or embankment in a uniform state so that settlement
is equable. By carefully watching the effect of heavy rain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>upon the slopes and the formation, the places where water
amasses can be traced, and means used to restore the surface
to the same condition as the other portions of a cutting or
embankment. As water is the chief cause of slips, the friction
and cohesion of earth being impaired and, perhaps, destroyed
by it, it is obvious that at the time percolation, which
varies greatly with the seasons, is at its maximum, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i> when
the earth becomes in a damp or wet state, slips are to be
most expected, and particularly soon after the commencement
of the wet season. It is known that upon the thawing of a
heavy fall of snow, and of quickly succeeding and separate
falls of snow, percolation is great; also after heavy and
continuous rains, especially if the strata dip towards a river,
and in the case of springs whose yield depends more upon
percolation than the amount of rainfall, a wet winter will
cause an increased flow some time after, when the earth may
become saturated.</p>

<p class='c000'>If it could be determined at what depth in any earth in
any state percolation, evaporation, and meteorological influences
would cease, and also their effects, rules could be
deduced for guidance in draining cuttings and embankments.
The manner of the execution of ordinary cuttings and embankments
is so dissimilar to that of filter-beds of waterworks,
that the experiments made for such purposes are only
of comparative value for the former works, for the condition
as well as the character of the soil affects its permeability by
water. For instance, in cuttings, with the exception of some
surface disturbance during the process of excavation, the
removal of vegetation or a covering, and the exposure of the
ground to the atmosphere, &amp;c., the normal state of the earth
is not much altered; but in embankments different soils may
be intermingled in a manner almost unknown in nature, the
varieties of mixtures of earth being most numerous, and they
may be in every condition of compactness, dryness, and
dampness amounting almost to saturation, and in any case,
therefore, percolation is temporarily or permanently increased
consequent upon the earth having been disturbed and
loosened.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>The general principles of the percolation of water are here
only briefly referred to, as they particularly concern slips in
earthwork: but obviously the quantity of percolated water
greatly affects the stability of a slope, for the surface water
should not be guidelessly allowed to soak into or be absorbed
by the ground at the top, and so proceed through and
down the slopes, as then the pent-up water tends to press
out the face which may be temporarily sun-dried. As in
excavating cuttings the surface is bared and vegetation
removed from the soil, water has easier access, and unless the
ground when excavated is immediately covered as before, its
normal state is not preserved. One point of considerable
importance is to ascertain whether in any cutting or embankment
percolation is uniform and regular; some infiltration
will necessarily take place, as water will gravitate from
the top to the bottom and will find the easiest course or line
of least resistance, which may not be at the lowest level.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the amount of the annual rainfall varies greatly according
to the country, and, even in England, considerably in
a small area, the earth will be more affected in one place
than another; for instance, 48 to 50 inches is approximately
the annual average rainfall upon the extreme S.S.W. coast of
England, being greatest at the highest level nearest the sea
and to leeward; it diminishes gradually from W. to E. to from
26 to 24 inches, the minimum of about 20 inches being in Essex.
The differences of quantity must therefore be regarded;
but such rainfall is as nothing compared with that of tropical
lands, for the fall often continues many hours, and yet equals
and perhaps exceeds an inch per hour. The heaviest fall
and its usual time of appearance should be ascertained, as
earthworks may have to be constructed in a peculiar district
where the rainfall may be more than double that of the
average wettest district, and it will often be much greater
at the foot or the top of neighbouring hills than on a flat
coast. Local information from reliable sources is the best
guide when confirmed by general knowledge. In the tropics
100 to 200 inches in depth of rain instead of 20 to 30 inches
has to be treated, and frequently half the total annual rainfall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>in England comes down in twenty-four hours. It is almost
superfluous to name that the protective works which would
be amply sufficient in one country may be useless in another,
simply because of the variation in the amount of the rainfall
and the capacity of different earths to resist or invite the
percolation of water.</p>

<p class='c000'>Obviously percolation will vary considerably with the
seasons, and a succession of wet periods or a continuous
downpour will increase the quantity of infiltrating water;
but the effect of a fall may not be experienced until some
time after it occurs, as in districts or rivers that are fed with
water from the thawing of snow upon surrounding or
distant hills water reaches the lower tracts of country in
hot and sunny, and therefore generally dry weather, when
evaporation is the greatest, and not in winter. Again, there
is generally very little rainfall over flat deserts, but an excess
upon mountain ranges which may surround a desert, and
especially in tropical countries experience has proved that
storms and rainfall are often local and extend over a small
area, one district being more liable to such a visitation than
another; they are also, as usual, of irregular duration and
severity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The position of a river may also affect the percolation of
water more upon one side of a valley than another, for a river
seldom has its course in the centre of a vale, but is generally
nearest to the steeper and higher side of a hill. The configuration
of a country governs to a great extent the flow
and quantity of the rainfall that sinks into the earth, as in
a hilly country and in impervious soil the water is quickly
discharged into an adjacent river, taking the easiest course.
In a flat country and pervious soil rain percolates the earth
and saturates the ground, or reappears in springs.</p>

<p class='c000'>As by drainage the retentive power of the soil is not
allowed free operation, water rapidly flows into the drains
instead of being chiefly held by the earth and watercourses,
and channels are sometimes created; and where the rainfall
is heavy or occurs in a comparatively short time floods may
be caused, although the soil when drained, and therefore in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>a drier state, absorbs more water than when undrained and
in a damp condition, water will pass through it quicker, and
the discharge is thus increased in volume and velocity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Earth may be in a damp state, either from mere surface
percolation and accumulation of water, or from springs
which may never cease to flow; on the contrary, in rainless
districts, from the almost perpetual daily drying power of the
sun, the earth is sometimes found to be firmest and hardest
upon the top, and for a few feet below it, than at greater
depths. Separate masses of vegetation usually indicate
damp places in a bare country.</p>

<p class='c000'>As rain flows more quickly from non-absorbent soil, such
as rock, and slowly permeable earth, as the clays, than from
porous soil, the surface discharge is greater; and unless the
water is guided, pools are likely to be formed and weak
places created, especially if the ground dips towards a
cutting. It is well to remember that a cutting being excavated
upon the side of a hill or upon table-land may
change the direction of the flow of the drainage waters, and
an embankment may obstruct and interfere with them, and
should the strata incline towards the excavation, it obviously
favours a discharge of water into it.</p>

<p class='c000'>If water permeates the soil or trickles down through
fissures or veins, it will continue to do so until an impervious
layer is reached, when it will be deflected and may become
a current; therefore, whenever a permeable stratum overlies
an impermeable, and the impermeable earth inclines, an
increased flow may be expected, as also near the junction of
tributary waters with streams or rivers.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a drained district, water will not usually be encountered
in large quantities until a depth is reached below the level
of general drainage, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>, about the invert of the nearest drains
or sewers, especially in porous soils, but in the case of a
pervious subsoil, such as sand or gravel, or if the tides rise
in an adjacent river or the sea to the level of any foundations
or above it, more water may percolate over the site or
drainage area than has time to flow away between tides, the
water will then rise, and systematic pumping becomes a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>necessity, unless the volume of the ingressing waters can
be sufficiently reduced by the deposition of an impervious
layer upon or in the river-bed or sea-shore, or by sheet-piling
or other means, or the flow confined, which may be a risky
operation in loose soil, depending upon its resistance to scour.</p>

<p class='c000'>In clay soils, so far as slips are concerned, the action
especially to be feared is the trickling of water down fissures
which may extend to depths below the bottom in cuttings
and create slimy surfaces, disconnecting masses of earth, and
finally offering a ready means of movement, which swelling
of the clay or vibration may complete. The experiments of
Mr. Baldwin Latham, M. Inst. C.E., on the absorption and
retention of water by clay soils, gave the following results:—The
stiffest clays retained the greatest quantity of water.
Clay soils can absorb and retain from 40 to 60 per cent. of
water by weight. Marly clays hold less water than the pure
clays. In the case of loamy soils, the percentage of water
retained varied from 35 to 60 per cent. by weight, the
mixture of sand and clay, therefore, limited the amount of
water which it would naturally hold.</p>

<p class='c000'>As in chalk soils fissures occur, the percolation of water
and the effects of the atmosphere through the pores causes
movement, and even crevices and breaks in rocks are not
to be disregarded with impunity, as they are channels of
disintegration.</p>

<p class='c000'>Most earths when dry attract water, but if they are
regularly irrigated, they require less moisture, depending
upon the nature of the earth, and slope and relative level
of the land. All soils when broken, as in embankments,
absorb more water than when in an unbroken state, as in
cuttings; for instance, it has been found by experiment that
clayey and retentive earths will absorb about 7 per cent.
more water, and light porous soils about 6 per centum. Of
course, the increment varies. Even wet retentive soil, if
handled, becomes considerably less impervious to moisture.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Evans, F.R.S., has proved by experiment that percolation
through pure chalk is much greater than through
ordinary top soil consisting of gravel, loam, and mould, both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>being covered with turf, and that in winter the average
proportions of percolation are as about 1 for soil to 1·5 for
chalk; in summer 1 for soil to 2·6 for chalk. The depth
also to which chalk will allow a passage of water is some 60
per cent. more than ordinary top soil.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rain will percolate through chalk or any open soil until
it meets an impervious stratum, or to that place which is in
a state of saturation, when the water must either flow away
or the level of saturation must gradually rise. This causes
rivulets to burst out in places after heavy rain, when the
water has had time to percolate, and the rainfall has exceeded
the average, but such springs will cease when the local excess
has terminated. However, in cuttings it is the flow from
fissures that is to be feared, and their size may indicate
the quantity of water that may be expected to issue from
them. It seems to be generally agreed that the supply of
water from chalk is derived from rain, which percolates
through innumerable fissures, and that in all rocks, whether
limestone, sandstone, granite, sand, or clay, it is by means of
the fissures, seams, and veins that the supply of water is
obtained from rain, and springs created.</p>

<p class='c000'>With regard to the percolation of water through sand, it
may always be expected to be very considerable, and the
soil may under certain conditions become water-charged.
Mr. Greaves, M. Inst. C.E., has shown by experiments
that the average percolation through ordinary top soil
is only about one-third of that of sand, but the evaporation
from a surface of ordinary soil was about four times more
than from a similar surface of sand, and also the amount of
percolation in ordinary top earth was small on the whole,
and, perhaps, the percolation through ordinary ground
would be about 25 per cent. of the rainfall, but 80 per cent.
in average sand.</p>

<p class='c000'>Experiments have also shown that the absorbent capacity
of sand decreases regularly according to the fineness of the
grain, and that “some sandy soils will not absorb more than
20 per cent., but sandy soil containing peat, as moorland, as
much as 80 per cent., both computed by weight.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>The quantity of water absorbed by loamy soil will vary
considerably according as clay or sand preponderates in the
mass. Earth may become so mixed with coarse or fine sand
that, when saturated, it approaches the condition of a quicksand.</p>

<p class='c000'>The general effect of percolation has been briefly described
as follows. Upon water entering the pores of an earth it
displaces the air or liquid previously present, forcing the
former upwards into the atmosphere, and the latter downwards.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having briefly referred to the percolation of water in
cuttings and embankments, the drainage is now considered.
It must be either precautionary, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>, to prevent a slip, or
remedial, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>, to drain a slip.</p>

<p class='c000'>The aim of any draining operations to prevent slips in
earthwork is to search for the source of water discharge, to
tap and gently conduct it away and prevent it reaching,
accumulating, percolating, or being confined within the slope
of a cutting, which it may then reduce to a pulpy condition;
its free effluxion being most important, as also the lessening
of the percolation of rain and surface-waters. The drainage
of cuttings or embankments may consist of wells, culverts,
closed or open channels, pipes, and tile drains of every
reasonable and economical form, and may be placed in
various positions. To describe them and the different
systems of draining is to open up a subject requiring several
volumes; here the endeavour is made to indicate whether
elaborate or ordinary drainage is required, or mere water-tables
and surface drains, and care in the process of excavation
and deposition, protection of the slopes, and in giving
them sufficient inclination to prevent movement. If possible
and time allows, the drainage in treacherous soils should
always be commenced before the main excavation, and, in
any case, simultaneously.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rock and solid impermeable earth may merely require to
be surface drained, but all treacherous and porous soil, deep
draining; and granular soils, which usually exude water
from the whole mass, demand different treatment to those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>earths which discharge water at particular places; but it
may be most difficult to drain a mixed soil, such as sandy
loam and silt. With the exception of a counterfort and
drain at the foot of a slope, and an impermeable catchwater
drain upon the slopes and top drains, to prevent and lessen
surface percolation, the best method to adopt in earth of this
description may be to sink wells at intervals to intercept the
flow or percolation of any ground waters; to attempt to drain
or draw out the water in the soil will end in comparative
failure. To reduce the volume of the percolating waters is
the object to be attained, and then evaporation, vibration,
which tends to shake down water, and time may gradually
convert the earth to the desired drier condition. The wells
can be filled with broken stone or coarse gravel to support
them, and prevent their closing.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is an advantage to prevent the percolation of water
into soil that will not readily part with it, such as the clay
earths, as it may be economically impossible to drain or
restore the earth to its normal condition, and should the
strata be upheaved, intermixed, and of a permeable and
impermeable character, a scientific application of drainage
can alone succeed. When the source of the water is
ascertained, it can be seen whether a complete system of
drainage is necessary over the whole of a cutting or only
a portion of the slopes. Dampness and the egression of
water may be merely local; if so, by boring a hole and
inserting a drain into a slope to tap the flow it may be
cured, the surface being made dry by a layer of ashes or
other absorbent material. Pipes or tile drains may be
sufficient when springs exist, or the flow of water is local,
and in loose soils it is especially advisable to provide openings
for cleaning any covered drains. Brickwork, masonry,
concrete, pipes, or other rigid drains, may not be suitable
for ground likely to unequally subside, as they will probably
crack or leak, and loose-jointed pipes or over-lapping tile
drains may be required. In treacherous clay soils surface
longitudinal and transverse drains will most probably be
insufficient, and deep draining of the mass be necessary, also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>the ground upon which earth is deposited will require to be
drained and a layer of rubble stone placed upon it, a cutting
or embankment being divided into small drainage areas by
deep open dry stone trenches.</p>

<p class='c000'>Water may not sufficiently percolate into a hill, either
because of its surface being covered with vegetation, or the
soil being of an impervious nature. It may then flow down
the slope of a cutting which will probably be bare and unprotected.
To prevent slips the discharge must be carefully
controlled and led away, particularly when the formation
is drift soil upon rock, or the earth will be liable to saturation
and degradation; also to prevent a flow of water under
its seat, and upon the natural ground, should an embankment
be deposited upon it.</p>

<p class='c000'>When a slope upon the hill-side of a cutting is of considerable
length and steepness, it is advisable to bench it and
divide it into a series of terraces and short slopes, and to
provide catchwater drains, with impermeable surfaces so as
to prevent any surface water attaining a high velocity, and
scouring power. All surface water upon the side of a hill
should be controlled, and catchwater drains may suffice to
do this.</p>

<p class='c000'>Should an impervious stratum be upheaved so as to make
a reservoir wall for water under the seat of an embankment,
it is useless to surface-drain the valley side of it in sidelong
ground, as it will not affect the waters that trickle down the
hill, which will be dammed up to the top level of the
impervious stratum, and may saturate the seat of an embankment
and cause a slip. In such a case through drainage
must be created from the hill to the valley, and the
impervious upheaved cap must be pierced so as not to
interfere with the passage of water.</p>

<p class='c000'>In countries where there is a certain dry and rainy season,
the necessary provision required for drainage must not be
computed from the visible effects of the rainfall soon after
the wet season has commenced, but the maximum flood may
be discerned when the earth has absorbed or retains the
moisture evaporated during the dry season, and becomes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>water-charged. In the tropics or exceptionally wet districts
the only effectual method of draining may be to divide the
area into small portions, as the rainfall may be so great,
sudden, and continuous that unless it naturally flows into
a channel, which should not be diverted or its course be
materially altered, it will be impossible to control the waters.
In an exceptional situation where a railway must be located
in a ravine and close to a river, and the material of which an
embankment is made is compact earth or the ground firm, it
may be advisable to allow the overflow waters of a river, or
the flow of surface water towards it, when the extreme flood
level is known, to gently pass over a line of railway, it
being kept at such a level as not to impede free working,
and to ensure that any back water is not prevented from
escaping. If not, an embankment may slip and require
extensive and frequent bridges, culverts, or drainage channels
in order to provide sufficient waterway, and to attain
permanent stability of the embankment.</p>

<p class='c000'>In all cases it is necessary to determine the depth to which
the drains must be placed to be effectual, and their position,
extent and number, and it should be remembered that the
fewer there are the greater will be the velocity and discharge;
also if many small drains are inserted the soil may
stand, but if only one or two are made the surface may
succumb to the erosive action of the flowing waters. The
provision of a water-table or the mere surface drainage of a
cutting, or the seat of an embankment may be of little use,
as the superimposed soil may slide upon a stratum, and unless
this bed is thoroughly drained rain may quickly destroy the
equilibrium. Of course, in the case of a slip, the drains to
be effectual must be placed below its level and down to the
layer upon which movement has occurred, especially in clay
and retentive and impervious earths, for instance, surface
drainage in yellow clay is almost useless.</p>

<p class='c000'>Should the source be known from which the water issues
the drainage may be local, and if a spring be unsealed it may
be necessary to insert pipes in the slope, for until the spring
is tapped and guided no system of drains may be effectual.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>By inserting a stand-pipe over a spring, the height to
which the water will rise will approximately show the head-level
of the supply. If possible, this should be ascertained,
as it may happen that the water can be drained by gravitation
in pipes without much excavation being required in the
slopes or formation; but care should be taken that no water
is allowed to settle or accumulate for the purpose of its being
conducted away unless upon a protected surface.</p>

<p class='c000'>With regard to catchwater drains upon the cess at the
top of the slopes, they should be cut before the excavation is
commenced; and it is important to remember that instead of
their affording protection by guiding the surface waters,
which would otherwise proceed towards the slopes, they may
increase the percolation by localizing the water and allowing
it to accumulate and find its way to the slope; and in sidelong
ground it may, therefore, be necessary to protect their
valley more than their uphill side, as the surface water will
impinge against it; but when they are practically impervious
and gently direct the surface water they are
advantageous, and in permeable soil, unless they are so
constructed as to be impervious, perhaps it is better to have
none. They should be as reasonably distant from the top of
the slope as is convenient without weakening the foundations
of the posts supporting any fencing, and in order to quickly
discharge the water and lessen the chance of their becoming
choked by detritus or ice, they should have considerable
inclination. As the adoption of even a moderate fall in the
drains may erode the side ditches and cause water to percolate
to the slopes and make a water-seam, it may be necessary
to protect the bottom, and as the depth of the side drains in
order to be effectual may be considerable, according to the
character of the soil, the sides may also require to be covered
and supported. In cuttings in many soils sufficient stones
can be picked out to cover the surfaces of the side drains, and
they can be roughly packed, the smaller stones being rammed
into the interstices between the larger, which will gradually
become filled; also a covering of brushwood, rammed earth,
or puddled clay can be used, or other expedient which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>occasion may suggest. The inclination must not be steeper
than the natural or protected bed can bear without the water
scouring it, and yet should be sufficient to prevent any
deposit or choking, and the drains should be cleared regularly,
and especially in the autumn in England or before the wet
season commences, and all depressions in which water can accumulate
should be levelled in order to assist easy discharge.
Small open drains become choked somewhat easily, and it is
therefore advisable to make them according to the nature
of the soil, situation, and requirements not less than 1 foot
6 inches to 3 feet in width at the top and 1 foot at bottom;
they may be from 1 foot to 3 feet in depth. Care should be
taken that the bends are not too abrupt or the water may
make its own course. A gentle curve considerably increases
the flow. The angle of a bend should be as easy as possible,
and not exceed 26° or 2 to 1.</p>

<p class='c000'>In sandy and loose soils, if unprotected, open drains may
be difficult to maintain even when filled with broken stone,
and covered or pipe drains be necessary, and those loosely
filled with stones or faggots may not succeed; in any case no
run of the sand must be allowed, and it is advisable to rapidly
construct them. In peaty soils, from subsidence of the
ground consequent upon draining, the drains often become
choked. The depth of a drain in the formation may require
to be deeper than elsewhere, as at the toe of the slope, the
weakest part, the water will generally be most abundant.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon railways, the advantage of thorough drainage of the
formation as regards the stability of the permanent way and
reduction of the cost of repairs is proverbial, but here is only
named in its relation to the prevention and the reparation of
slips.</p>

<p class='c000'>When field drains are intercepted in the slopes, drain
pipes or timber ducts should be joined to them and be
connected with the general drainage of a cutting. Draining
the slopes, providing outlets for the water, and also support
to the earth can be effected by means of a counterfort of permeable
material at the toe of the slope, with its foundation a
few feet below formation level, with open drains at right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>angles or obliquely to it extending from the foe to the top of
the slope.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c019'><sup>[1]</sup></a> These open drains and trenches can be filled
with stones, gravel, hard chalk, ashes, brushwood and gravel,
broken bricks, burnt clay or other suitable material; and a
simple covering of picked ashes, &amp;c., over a moist place in a
clay cutting of little depth may be sufficient. The distance
apart of such trenches in clay cuttings generally ranges
between 10 and 33 feet; their location must be governed by
the consideration that they exist in order to prevent a
localization of water in the slopes: their width is usually
from 2 feet to 8 feet, and most frequently 4 to 6 feet, and
the depth from 1 foot 6 inches to 3 feet and upwards, below
the surface of the slope, but in very wet embankments a
width from 6 to 10 feet and of such a depth as the soil will
allow without extensive support. If the earth has not
slipped, and it should be found that the ground is wet for
from 6 to 8 feet or so beneath the surface, and the depth of
the trench is made about half that of the wetted soil, it is
sufficient to collect the water, but if it has slipped most
probably such drains will not be effectual until carried down
below the seat of movement. At the foot of a slope these
drains should be connected with longitudinal channels
parallel to the formation to gently convey the water to the
nearest outlet. The location, distance apart, depth, width,
and direction of the trenches must be governed by the
nature of the soil, the depth of a cutting or height of an
embankment, the area of the surface to be drained, the
quantity of water in it, the presence of water-seams and
weak places, and by other minor considerations.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>With respect to the material with which the trenches
should be filled, a uniform substance having considerable
power of absorption, and but few particles between the
interstices, is to be preferred, as the trickling of water and
vibration causes the smaller material to fall towards the
bottom of the trench, which, therefore, may become partly
choked, and free drainage be interrupted at the toe of the
slope, the most vulnerable place. As sand is always present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>in unwashed gravel, it will gradually flow or fall to the base
of the trench and will prevent equal drainage, but properly
burnt clay, being a more uniform and fragmentary substance,
is better than sandy gravel, as it is dry and porous; but much
depends upon it being well burnt or it may weather. Ashes
and chalk are excellent collectors of water and are usually of
an even character, but ashes are better than chalk, as the
latter material, unless very hard, is liable to become disintegrated
by the action of the atmosphere, rain, and frost. The
difficulty with respect to ashes is to obtain them in sufficient
quantity, free from dust, and of the requisite size. When
weight is required as well as drainage, burnt clay, gravel,
or chalk is to be preferred to ashes. Burnt clay, although
burned upon the site, is generally a more expensive material
than gravel, but the amount of moisture in the clay will
principally determine the quantity of fuel necessary to burn
it, and therefore the cost. If shale is present, by thoroughly
igniting it the expense of burning may be nearly reduced to
that of lighting and turning over, as it will usually burn unaided.
All trenches should drain into pipes placed below the
formation or into open drains at a sufficient distance from the
toe of a slope as not to deleteriously affect it, in order that
the water may be controlled and gently conveyed to an outlet.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chief objection to open drains is that all excavated
trenches or inserted drains in the slopes destroy the cohesion
of the earth and aid in detaching portions of the surface.
If the cohesion and adhesion of the soil were the same under
every condition, this would be a cogent reason against the
system, but, as in earthwork, every degree of moisture from
dampness to saturation may be attained, the cohesive power
is a very variable quantity, apart from the effects of
vibration; and also open drains undoubtedly do cause a
slope to be drier, and moderate local humidity, and therefore
increase the cohesion and general stability of the part
drained; the only fear being that from inattention they may
become choked; then they are dangerous, as they will
permanently collect and retain water instead of temporarily
retaining and gently guiding it. A careful consideration of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>the circumstances may much reduce this objection by
indicating whether it is advisable to have only a few deep,
or several small surface drains. Provided proper precautions
are taken, experience indicates that filled-in trenches in the
slopes are generally successful, and certainly are simpler and
cheaper than a retaining wall at the toe of a slope. In
pervious soil it may be economically impossible to drain the
slopes unless they are divided into sections, and should
the material in the trenches be well-packed and pressed
down, it may even increase the friction between the
separated portions.</p>

<p class='c000'>In connection with the drainage of cuttings may be
named that excavation should not be allowed to be cast upon
the cess unless some distance from the edge of a slope, and
only temporarily for purposes of ballasting and metalling;
as such spoil-banks increase the load and localize the water
to be drained.</p>

<p class='c000'>A more complete system of drainage may be necessary
than those previously named, consisting of a combination of
wells, open, or holding filtering material; pipe-drains or
filled-in trenches, wells with a pipe leading to a catchwater
drain, &amp;c., or other usual methods of land drainage. For
instance, it may be discovered that water issues from a
spring outside the fence or cutting; if so, in order to drain
the slopes it may be necessary to sink a well to a stratum
below the formation level so as to tap the spring, thereby
preventing an exudation of water upon the slope; this is a
better plan than drawing the water into the slope and then
draining it.</p>

<p class='c000'>When pervious earth overlies an impervious stratum, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>,
gravel or sand upon clay, rough-filled wells at intervals
inside the fence extending 3 or 4 feet into the clay,
with an outlet drain, may be required to prevent a flow of
water upon the clay and a wetted surface upon which the
gravel can slide; and it may be necessary to have a cess on
the slope between the top of the clay and the bottom of the
gravel or sand, with a catchwater drain upon it, particularly
in a cutting in sidelong ground.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Should the soil be silty sand, or be charged with water,
consequent upon the formation of the country, it may be
impossible to drain a cutting without a complete system of
wells, catchwater drains and pipes, and even then it may be
difficult to separate the water from the earth. In building a
drain-shaft it should be remembered that it may not only be
subject to a compressive strain, but also to transverse strain
and flexure from different pressures of the earth at various
depths, especially when the soil is not the same throughout,
and unequally damp.</p>

<p class='c000'>When “boils” occur in sand-cuttings, perhaps the
cheapest expedient is to place a shaft over the boil, weight
the bottom sufficiently to prevent a movement of the sand,
but to allow the water to escape, and make a discharge
outlet after having ascertained its head level: <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vide</span></i> Chapter
XII. On no account should a spring be stopped, as such
action will result in its diversion to some other place; but
the water flowing from it should be guided and discharged.
Weighting may arrest a slip in any sandy soil, also clay or
any impervious material placed upon the sand, or sinking a
well outside a cutting to a depth of some 5 feet below the
bottom may effect a remedy by abstracting the surplus
water, but care must be taken not to disturb the sand.</p>

<p class='c000'>Slips in embankments frequently occur from the percolation
of water through the formation to the slopes, and so to
the toe, the lower portions become disintegrated by moisture
and the effects of weather, and cause the upper parts to
slide or move. To lessen percolation and to prevent an
accumulation of water upon the formation, it is usual for its
centre to be raised a few inches above the level of the top of
the slope. This is undoubtedly a good practice, as it also
tends to drain the ballast, but it may be nullified in time if
the entire width of the formation be not covered with an
impermeable layer or with ballast; for when an unprotected
space remains between the toe of the slope of the ballast and
the top of the slope of an embankment, water is liable to
percolate through the cess and cause a slope to become wet
and unstable; particularly so if the ballast is broken rock
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>and has side walls instead of slopes, as then a depression
will probably be made by the platelayers or signalmen
walking upon the cess. In all cases where the material is
treacherous or likely to slip, it is advisable to cover the top
of embankments of considerable height throughout their
width with ballast or some impervious soil, provided the
permanent way is also properly drained. This is the
simplest precaution to take respecting the preservation of
the formation level or summit of an embankment. All
grass, dirt, and refuse should be regularly removed from it
and anything that obstructs free drainage. The nature of
the ballast also affects the evenness of the surface of the
formation, as if it consists of broken rock, the equal and
regular packing of the sleepers is not so easily effected as
with gravel ballast; the sleepers are frequently not uniformly
supported throughout their length, the pressure upon the
formation is localized, depressions are formed and water
collected, and slips and subsidences in soils of a treacherous
nature may be induced from this cause, as the equilibrium is
soon disturbed. The formation should be so drained and
constructed that water cannot percolate to or cause the
surface to become soft and work up into or through the
ballast, or a state of unsettlement will be produced by water
soaking through the ballast to an embankment, and so
saturating part of it and forcing out the upper portion of a
slope. In all close granular ballast cross channels should be
made to lead away the surface water. Transverse open tile-drains
may be required leading to an impervious channel.
Water has been known to percolate through a considerable
depth of ballast when added to restore a sunken embankment,
even through as much as 7 to 10 feet when two falling
gradients induced a flow of the surface waters to one place.
In certain situations it may be necessary should an
embankment be of clay or treacherous soil when wet, to
cover the formation with an impervious stratum to prevent
percolation to the embankment, and to thoroughly and
separately drain the ballast placed upon it.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the base of an embankment a ditch should be cut upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>the higher side, or both sides, as near as convenient to the
fence. When in addition to the interception of any surface
waters by an embankment the ground is very retentive of
moisture, it may be necessary to drain the seat; with this
object trenches can be excavated at intervals at right angles
or obliquely to the centre line of the embankment, and be
filled with some hard filtering substance, such as stone or
gravel, so as to effect and control the discharge of the
waters. Should this be too expensive a method to adopt,
and always provided the surface waters are prevented from
flowing or trickling into the base of an embankment, the
ground might be excavated so as to equally incline downwards
towards the centre, the level at that point being 1 foot
to 2 feet below the toe of the slope on each side, according to
the width of the base of the embankment; a small trench
being cut in the centre and filled with stones, and covered
at the top with brushwood or hurdles or other provision
necessary to ensure it being permanently an effectual water
channel, with occasional or other drains to lead the water to
the nearest culvert or side ditch. When it is found that
water passes over the surface of firm soil upon which an
embankment is deposited, the water must be intercepted
and led away; and should an embankment be of retentive
earth, in order to tap the water that has flowed and percolated
into it, and to restore the earth to its normal condition and
prevent slips and subsidences, it may be necessary to sink
shafts to a depth of a few feet below the seat of an embankment
until the mass is drained.</p>

<p class='c000'>With regard to culverts, a settlement or slip of an embankment
over a culvert may unequally strain, fracture, and
displace portions of it, and therefore interrupt the flow of
the drainage waters, which may then reach the seat of an
embankment and cause it to be in a dangerous condition.
They are usually necessarily placed at the deepest point of
an embankment, and consequently the most difficult to make
repairs. In such a situation they should be built sufficiently
large to allow of the easy passage of a man, in order that due
inspection may be made, and be constructed of materials of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>durable character. Should a naturally firm bank exist on
one or both sides of a stream, it should be stripped of all plant
growth and decaying matter, and be preserved in order to
form a natural wall to relieve a culvert from side pressure,
but firm or hard material must be inserted between the back
of the wall and the face of the stream bank so as to support
the wall against the pressure it receives from the arch.
This leads to a consideration of the best form of culvert. In
clay soils, and those which exert pressure from expansion,
especially if the culvert is surrounded by clay earth, the
circular is generally considered to be the best form, and this
has been proved to be so in tunnels in similar soil, with splayed
wing-walls to assist and guide the flow and help to keep a clear
entrance. In granular soils, such as dry sand or gravel, the
earth acts differently and more in accordance with the angle
of repose theory of pressure, therefore the strain upon the
arch would be the greatest, and its thrust must be counterbalanced
at the sides, the strain upon the invert being
probably very little and due to the tendency to an overturning
movement of either of the straight walls. However,
in culverts as in tunnels, it is impossible to say the exact
amount or direction of the strain, although it may be
approximately computed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Should it be necessary to erect a culvert upon soft ground,
as much of it as practicable should be excavated and a
concrete foundation be placed thereon; it is also advisable
to allow an extra length to that required by the calculated
slope.</p>

<p class='c000'>A culvert should have an invert unless upon a hard rock
bed, and care should be taken that there shall be no leakage
at the springing of the inverted arch or under it, or beneath
the sidewalls at the level of the surface of a flat stone drain
or below it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The banks of a stream or watercourse should be inspected
occasionally, especially on the up-stream side of a culvert, in
order to note whether they are stable or crumbling away, as
then the course of the stream may be widened or diverted,
and so erode the toe of an embankment and cause a slip of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>earth. Splayed wing-walls are a protection against such a
danger besides aiding the flow of water through them, and
they also lessen the chance of a damming back of the water
and undermining, as they increase the discharge; for instance,
a splay of 53° has been found to increase the flow about 25 per
centum. The surface of the material of which a culvert is
constructed should be as smooth as practicable, so as to reduce
the friction of water flowing past it, which, in the case of
unplaned timber, cast and wrought ironwork, ashlar masonry,
brickwork, and concrete, is about the same, but is some 30
per cent. more when the surface consists of rubble masonry.</p>

<p class='c000'>When an embankment crosses a narrow valley, in which
no watercourse exists, instead of a culvert, a bed of loose
stones has been placed upon the ground under the whole
area of the seat of an embankment at its greatest depth, a
proper fall and bed being given to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The toe of the slope on the up-stream side should be protected
from any wash, and the stone layer be carried a few
feet beyond the foot of the slope on the lower side.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following general principles it is well to remember in
designing culverts.</p>

<p class='c000'>When a culvert is of uniform section, which is almost
invariably the case, it should have the same inclination
throughout.</p>

<p class='c000'>Avoid, or ease, all bends as much as possible.</p>

<p class='c000'>Have splayed wing-walls.</p>

<p class='c000'>Make provision against undermining by scour or percolation
of water.</p>

<p class='c000'>Have smooth and even surfaces so as to reduce the friction
and increase the discharge.</p>

<p class='c000'>Have an arched invert to a culvert, and a flat bed stone to
all small surface drains, with complete connection to the side
walls.</p>

<p class='c000'>In some countries having a severe climate, or in high
mountainous districts where the soil is rock and a heavy
discharge of flood-waters occurs, instead of placing a culvert
and gathering the waters at or about the level of the toe of
an embankment, in deep hillsides or ravines an unlined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>tunnel is made under the embankment in the rock, thus
avoiding a masonry or brickwork structure, which could
only be set in the summer months, and preventing the
waters touching the seat of an embankment and promoting
a slip.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the level of a rivulet allows, and the waters are
simply surface discharge, the system has been used of
making two open channels, one upon each side of a steep
valley, thus retaining the waters, allowing the adoption of
two short span open culverts and two channels instead of
one large culvert at the deepest place, and saving expense,
the original bed of watercourse being filled with the surplus
excavation. The embankment consisting of broken rock
or hard granular soil, any little percolation of water along
the old bed will not deleteriously affect it, but will find a
passage.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Approximate Safe Maximum Load upon Different Earths.—Normal
Pressure of the Earth.—The Safe Maximum Load upon Deposited
Earth.—Approximate Safe Maximum Height of an Embankment.</span></p>

<p class='c005'>There is no limit to the depth of a cutting except a due
regard to economical construction, provided the slopes are
sufficiently flat, and the lateral and upward fluid pressure in
the slope, and formation and quantity of water not too great
for the stability of the earth; but, in the case of embankments,
the load upon the ground and the deposited material
in great measure restricts the height, or necessitates an
embankment being gradually spread out, so as to enlarge
the bearing area as the weight is increased.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following values of the safe maximum compressive load
have been compiled from actual practice, but are, of course,
only intended as a guide to the safe load for foundations
excavated in ground not artificially deposited. The condition
of the earth in each case should be considered, and
in works of magnitude it is advisable to make experiments
extending as long as practicable, and for at least a month, and
it is false economy not to carefully ascertain the character,
condition and other circumstances of a foundation destined
to support any part of a structure, a failure of which may
result in serious consequences; and it should be borne in
mind that a continuous surface possesses greater sustaining
power than the same area in detached portions, as the
adhesion of the sides is not destroyed; similarly, the load
that a tenacious earth will support upon a small area is somewhat
greater than over a large area, because the lateral
surfaces are relatively larger in proportion to the area, and,
therefore, the effect of cohesion is proportionately greater;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>but in loose soils it is not so, for cohesion exists but in name,
and the ground around would be upheaved upon an
excessive load being superimposed. In testing the weight
any earth will support, it is not so much the first settlement,
provided it is not excessive, that it is desirous to know,
but whether after the first settlement it ceases or the earth,
as it were, reacts and rebounds, which it may do in firm
ground to the extent of one-eighth to half an inch. If so,
the ground is not overloaded.</p>

<p class='c000'>After ascertaining by experiment the pressure any earth
will bear over a given area, the object should be to make the
soil neither drier nor wetter than that of its natural state
when experimenting, and it should be maintained in that
condition. In testing the weight which a soft earth will
support, some days should be allowed for the sinking of the
test platform, and such subsidence should be ascertained
periodically by careful levels. A month is not too long for
a reliable and complete test, as many soft soils continue to
yield. In soft clay soils considerable depression often proceeds
for weeks after a load has been applied, but except in
peculiar earths such settlement will ultimately be imperceptible,
and will practically cease. A considerable
margin of stability should in all cases be allowed. Although
it may not be absolutely necessary to experiment when the
nature of the ground is well known, wherever stability is of
great importance, the cost of a practical experiment being so
small, there is no sufficient reason why an actual test
of the sustaining power of the soil should not be made in the
majority of instances, for there are many earths whose
friction and cohesiveness can alone be depended upon for
resistance to displacement. In such cases the initial pressure
upon the earth should not be much exceeded.</p>

<p class='c000'>In loose non-cohesive earths the load may be increased,
when the depth is considerable, as the soil has been subject
to a greater normal pressure due to the weight of the soil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>upon it at any depth; but it is not advisable to consider
such increase of bearing power of the soil, unless at any depth
it is found that the normal pressure augments the bearing
power and makes the earth more dense, which may be
approximately ascertained by experiment. In such event
the load upon the base can be increased by the weight of the
normal pressure removed. Supposing 5 tons per square foot
was known to be the safe load upon the surface of the ground,
and at any depth it was found that the normal pressure of
the soil was 2 tons; 5 + 2 = 7 tons placed at that depth would
equal 5 tons at the surface. In the worst case, when the
loose earth is of great depth, and it is certain that it cannot
be tapped or disturbed at the depth at which it is decided to
place the foundations of a structure, provided the load is not
more than the normal pressure, it is not probable that it will
subside or slip, as no additional weight is imposed.</p>

<p class='c000'>In foundation and general work, rocks are usually not
loaded with a greater weight than from 8 to 18 tons per
square foot, according to the character of the rock. As the
crushing strength has been principally ascertained from
cubes, and not from prisms, rectangular blocks, or irregularly
shaped pieces, and as the resistance of rocks to transverse
strain or breaking across is considerably less than the compressive
strength, and varies greatly and not always according
to the crushing resistance of the material, from 8 to 20
tons per square foot is a prudent limit for the safe load, and
should not be exceeded unless under exceptional circumstances;
as unequal bearing may greatly intensify the
strain, and irregularity in the texture may reduce the
resisting powers to that of the weakest part. Sandstone rock
that can be crumbled in the hand should not be loaded with
more than 1½ to 1¾ ton per square foot, or it will probably
begin to flake and disintegrate. The strength of sandstone
varies very greatly, and in experiments it has been found that
when fine close grained, it supported before being crushed
five times the weight that very coarse gritty sandstone,
having a sandy appearance, would sustain; the respective
crushing pressures per square foot being 362 and 67 tons.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Reference to authorities on the resistance of stones to
crushing, tension and transverse strain, will give the
approximate safe load per square foot; but in foundations,

one-tenth of the ultimate resistance, and the compressive
strength should not alone be taken as a guide to the safe
load, but the resistance of the rock to tensional and transverse
strain should be considered. The value given for
crumbling sandstone is for the softest material that can be
called rock, and is merely stated to show that although some
earths may be generally classed as rocks their bearing power
may be limited. The safe load upon an artificial rubble
mound foundation depends upon its character, and firmness
and solidity when deposited, and upon that of the ground on
which it is placed. No general values can be named,
although it may be classed as clean or compact gravel.</p>

subsidence from overweighting, there is a limit to the height
of an embankment, apart from economical considerations of
its deposition. The problem to determine is, therefore, the
limit of the height to which an embankment may be
deposited without exceeding the safe load that the natural
ground will permanently sustain. The safe load upon the

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>In determining the safe load upon deposited earth it is
well to remember that:</p>

<p class='c000'>1. Excavated earth cannot be restored in bulk to its
original condition.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. When the earth is simply deposited from a tip head, it
cannot be immediately consolidated by the act of deposition.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. Until subsidence may, for all practical purposes, be considered
at an end, no deposited earth can be regarded as
stable; but a mere uniform weathering of the surface, which
cannot be prevented when the exterior is uncovered, will
generally not cause instability of the mass.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. Upon most public works the earth in an embankment is
exposed in thin layers.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. The earth is loaded, in the great majority of cases, soon
after it is deposited and before it has settled or become
consolidated, and is also subject to vibration from earth
waggons, locomotives, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. The comparative dry or wet state of the deposited
earth and its power of resistance to meteorological deterioration.
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vide</span></i> also Chapter IX.</p>

<p class='c000'>Taking into consideration these and other deteriorating
influences, the problem to be solved is, what deduction must
be made from the safe load upon unexcavated earth in
foundations, in order to know the safe sustaining power of
the same earth when deposited in an embankment? Much
depends upon the liability of the soil to become saturated or
in a damper state than that in which it is known to be
stable. For this reason the height of embankments in clay
soils, which are so deleteriously affected by the weather, is
generally made as little as possible. Of course, temporarily
an embankment will stand with a greater pressure, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>, at a
greater height than the safe height, and, provided no lateral
movement took place, an embankment would be stable until
the earth was nearly crushed; but permanent stability and
freedom from slips and subsidence is the object to be attained,
and everything must be subject to local conditions, such as
the amount of rainfall, the situation, the care exercised
during deposition, the protection given to the surface, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>the general drainage, and these must always govern the
application of any general rule. It is, therefore, necessary
to divide earths into two kinds, namely:—granular and non-granular;
the former is assumed to have particles, for
purposes of earthwork, insoluble in water, the latter to be
liable to be dissolved by aqueous action, or to be so affected
by it as to lessen the stability. It is impracticable to determine
by a formula the permanent safe maximum height of
an embankment; the values named are, however, an approximately
reliable indication of the height, and are based upon
the assumption that the slopes are sufficiently flat to be
stable, and that the embankments are deposited in the
ordinary way, the width of the formation or top being not
less than about 15 feet. It is seldom economical to make an
embankment more than 70 to 90 feet in height, except for
short lengths, and where deep cuttings cannot be avoided,
and it becomes a question of tipping spoil banks or main
embankments, or the foundations for a viaduct are known to
be of a treacherous and doubtful character. The heights
named have been calculated under the worst conditions, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>,
that any weight upon the formation will be directly communicated
to the base as in the case of a column, and not
through the cross-section of an embankment, and over the
whole area of the base; however, there is always the danger
that the central portion may subside, as the weight upon it
is the greatest, and that the slopes may be disturbed and
pressed out, especially in soft or soluble earth likely to be
quickly affected by moisture. The soil is considered to have
no reliable cohesion.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this country the limits of general practice for the
height of embankments when unaided by retaining walls or
other support, but with the slopes soiled, covered with
grass, and only externally drained, has been as follows:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Surface soils, about 20 to 30 feet.</div>
      <div class='line'>Boulder clay from 25 to 30 feet.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yellow, or ordinary clay, 30 to 40 feet.</div>
      <div class='line'>Ditto, ditto, in cuttings, 60 to 65 feet.</div>
      <div class='line'>Chalk, 30 to 40 feet.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Gravel and sand, about 60 feet.</div>
      <div class='line'>Ditto, in cuttings, 80 feet.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>These have, however, been exceeded in many instances,
especially upon the lower side of an embankment upon sidelong
ground. Probably the highest artificial embankments
unsupported by walls or any protective works, are quarry
and mining-tips, and ballast-heaps. These have been cast
out in all weathers, and allowed to assume any slope or
shape, and to a height as great as 100 to 120 feet, and have
remained stable, although usually in an exposed situation,
but almost free from vibration.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Chapter VI. a railway embankment 90 feet in height,
in treacherous clay-soil is instanced, and there are many
embankments of various earths from 70 to 90 feet in height
on the centre line, but a railway embankment exceeding 100
feet in height on the centre line is rare, although the height
from the toe of the slope to the formation level in sidelong
ground may be frequently exceeded. A short and very
high embankment may stand where one of considerable
length would slip, consequent upon variations in the
character and condition of the earth, the bearing capacity of
the ground, the state of the weather, the flow of the surface
water, general homogeneousness, the configuration of the
ground, and other deteriorating influences; but draining,
careful deposition, and a judicious adoption of the varying
slope system, and other precautionary works, will conduce to
stability. Unless in exceptional circumstances, it is advisable
to avoid very high embankments, as a slip of earthwork
seldom gives much prevenient notice, and the works of
reparation can scarcely be effected by any means than
manual labour. The quantity of earth to be treated may be
so large that before the remedial works can be completed a
wet season may arrest operations and cause additional movement
and subsidence of the earth.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—The earths named will generally have their bearing power
increased by careful deposition in an embankment, for the act of equal
separation of the mass will cause a decrease in the quantity of water
contained in them: and they will be relieved of the water-pressure to
which they were liable in their natural position. On the contrary, when
carelessly tipped they may be deteriorated. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vide</span></i> Chapter IX.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>In the case of all earths that are readily impaired by
water, it is the degree of permanent uniform dryness or
wetness that governs the safe height of an embankment; for
even the surface of the most impervious clay will be liable
to become in a muddy state, although in the mass it may
be dry or in a condition conducive to stability. Almost
all aluminous or calcareous earths hold or retain water in
varying quantity, and as in embankments this may constantly
change, no safe permanent height of an embankment
in such soils can be established. The most solid
impermeable clay when separated into small pieces and
impregnated with water to any quantity above that it
normally contains, will have its bearing power and general
stability reduced, until, when saturated, it becomes as mud.
Impure and argillaceous chalk, marly clay, marl, and shale,
are all more or less weakened by aqueous action, and their
safe permanent height may be anything not exceeding the
crushing strength of the earth, with a due allowance for the
deteriorating influences of weather, vibration, and internal
water-pressure.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this chapter reference has been made to certain limits
of the safe height of embankments; but were these to be
adopted as <em>the</em> maximum safe height in each earth it would
be an indefensible edict, for by the adoption of the required
precautionary measures named in the several chapters of
this book the height can be considerably increased, and
what is more, has been much exceeded with impunity in
numerous instances. The inclination that any earth
assumes, after being exposed to the weather a sufficient time
for it to be affected by it, will afford a good indication of the
safe load it will support. As the slope of repose becomes
flatter, the bearing power of the soil in an embankment will
be reduced, all the deteriorating influences being identical.</p>

the Cohesion of Earth.—Form of a Slope.—Some Conditions

<p class='c005'>With regard to the inclination and the form of a slope, and
the prevention of slips in earthwork, in any slip the surface
must be affected; therefore, to determine the slope of permanent
stability of any earth, whether in a cutting or an
embankment, is of great importance. An unnecessarily flat
slope is not only a monetary waste but may be a cause of
instability, for it exposes a larger surface to deterioration
by the weather. By what means is a correct decision to be
attained? Experience has shown that certain earths under
known conditions will repose at particular inclinations;
however, to empirically assume that any earth will always
stand under any circumstances is clearly imprudent and
untenable. As a guide, a table of slopes for earths is valuable,
but consideration of the consequences of movement,
and the distinctive features of each case should govern a
decision.</p>

<p class='c000'>Should the earth be treacherous and require a flat slope, it
may be advisable to reduce the quantity of excavation by
the erection of a retaining wall, not only to effect a saving
in expenditure, but also to permanently support the soil, and
prevent instability.</p>

<p class='c000'>An inspection of neighbouring quarries and the waste
tips, sand or gravel pits, hills and cliffs, cuttings and
embankments for roads, river banks, &amp;c., will afford an
indication of any local peculiarities caused by the climate
or otherwise; and a comparison of the natural slopes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>assumed when the soil has to withstand vibration, and
when not so disturbed, will enable a judgment to be formed
of its deleterious effect upon the earth; but above all, an
examination of the cuttings and embankments passing
through or upon the same geological formation. Reliable
evidence can be so obtained upon which the slope of permanent
repose can be determined according to the dictates
of science and experience, but the probable consequences of
instability will demand a due regard to provision against
contingent deteriorating influences which may almost destroy
cohesion and render it necessary to rely solely upon frictional
resistance, the remaining resisting power against movement
of the earth, except in solid rock, which may stand with an
overhanging or vertical face, whereas mud and quicksand
may not be in a state of rest even when horizontal.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following table of slopes for different earths has been
carefully compiled to indicate the probable permanent slope,
but it should not be separately considered from the other
chapters in this book, as circumstances modify even a
considerable range of inclinations; for instance, earths that
will be stable at a certain slope in temperate climates will
require a much flatter slope in tropical or very cold countries.
Those named are more especially for artificially deposited or
embanked earths subject to vibration, and, therefore, in
cuttings the slope might be steeper, although not so in
aluminous soils or those in which the particles become
decomposed upon exposure. In Chapter II., under the head
of each kind of earth, the approximate slopes of repose are
more exactly named, as they would occupy too much space
in a table. When not mentioned in Chapter II. the slope is
given.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>General Note.</span>—The slopes must be flatter according to
the amount of water in the same soil or to which it may
be subject, the depth of a cutting and height of an embankment,
and the presence of all other disturbing influences.

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—If an exposed coast, the rubble may require from 4 to 1 to 7 to 1
slope, depending upon its size, the currents, depth, and “fetch” of the sea,
and solidity of the mass.</p>

<p class='c000'>The usual slopes adopted for cuttings and embankments
may be said to range from 1 to 1 for firm earth, having
particles not seriously affected by water or weather, to 4

and 1½ to 1 in embankments.</p>

<p class='c000'>With respect to the chief organ of stability in earths
other than rock, namely, the frictional resistance; friction
during motion is generally considered to be less than the
force necessary to overcome it when at rest, and undoubtedly
this is the case when the surfaces are similar, and are smooth
and hard and not easily impressed, as iron, granite, concrete,
and metals generally; but when they are comparatively soft
and incapable of resisting indentation at any pressure that
they may have to bear, the difference between the coefficient
of friction during motion and that at the commencement of
motion or of repose will not be so marked, for other resistances
may come into action not due <em>solely</em> to surface
friction of the mass. A surface may become indented or
roughened thus offering opposition to motion not existing
at the commencement of movement, and particularly so in
any earth of a mixed character possessing hard particles,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>such as boulders, or sand in clay. On the other hand, in the
case of hard rock, solid clay, or other homogeneous earth, the
difference between friction during motion and that of friction
at rest may be reliably determined.</p>

<p class='c000'>In soils of a granular or gritty nature small particles
become detached during motion, and by pressure occupy or
become wedged into any cavities upon the surfaces, and
therefore offer resistance which is not <em>alone</em> due to friction
of a mass upon a like mass. From this cause friction during
motion may seemingly even become greater than during rest,
but with material consisting of rounded particles that will
not wedge, the friction upon a sliding surface may be
lessened by reason of the grains revolving.</p>

<p class='c000'>In deducing a slope of repose for earth, the lowest value
of frictional resistance, whether during motion or at rest,
should be taken, and always as if the surfaces were wet.
The coefficients of friction, F, during motion usually range
between 0·25 to 1·10, and the slope of repose, S to 1, is
consequently found by the expression—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>S = <span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>F</span></span>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>therefore, S would equal to <span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>0·25</span></span> to <span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>1·10</span></span> = 4 to 1 <span class='fss'>TO</span> 0·91 to 1,
say, 1 to 1.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is the required inclination to prevent movement
provided no pressure is exerted upon the surface, and not
taking into consideration the disturbing and weakening
effects of vibration and all other deteriorating influences,
such as the variable degree of moisture of the soil, the
irregularity of its character, the destruction of the continuity
of the surface by trenches or drains in a slope, the effect of
gravity to detach a mass, the process of excavation or deposition,
and the expansion and contraction of soils of an
argillaceous nature. When any earth becomes suddenly
water-charged or deteriorated by any of the agencies
previously and subsequently mentioned, movement may
be expected, and it should be remembered that in the same
soil the resisting powers to disintegration frequently vary,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>consequent upon inequality in the quantity of moisture,
the roughness, evenness, smoothness, compactness, looseness,
the degree of fineness of the earth, and also the manner in
which strain is applied.</p>

<p class='c000'>Friction upon a dry surface is almost invariably greater
than that upon a wetted surface, and is so beyond all
question upon any plane lubricated with an unguent. The
disturbing and enfeebling effect of water may be judged
from a careful analysis of many reliable experiments to
ascertain the frictional resistance in the case of the same
material in a dry and in a wet state on an unplaned surface
of cast iron and on timber piles. It shows the following
results in addition to those given in the table of coefficients
of friction of earth upon earth in the next page.</p>

<p class='c000'>The surface friction of masonry or brickwork upon dry clay
is reduced by from 25 to 30 per cent. when the clay is wet.</p>

<p class='c000'>The frictional resistance of an unplaned surface of cast
iron upon wet sand is about 16 per cent. less than the
resistance upon the same material when dry. In the case
of timber piles, it is about 12 per cent. less, and about 40
per cent. less in sandy clay and gravelly clay soil.</p>

<p class='c000'>In sandy gravel the difference in the resistances is small,
being only from 5 to 10 per cent. less when the earth is wet.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sand has about 20 per cent. more friction than sandy
gravel, both materials being in a wet state; and below a
depth of from 10 to 15 feet, the frictional resistance increases
little in gravelly sand and gravelly soils.</p>

<p class='c000'>In lieu of a sufficient example under similar conditions
and circumstances, the most reliable method to ascertain
the slope of repose of any earth is that of S, the slope of
repose, to 1, = <span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>F</span></span>, any cohesion of the soil being disregarded
and considered as a margin of stability liable to
be much impaired; and, therefore, except in a mass, it is
prudent to look upon it as non-existent in the whole of a
slope; and when motion has commenced, as even a means
of accelerating movement by causing lumps to become
displaced instead of mere particles.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>The following coefficients of friction during motion are
here given in confirmation of the frictional resistance of an
earth being an indicator of its slope of repose.</p>

<p class='c000'>They have been tabulated from different authorities, are
the average results of practical experiments, and have been
compared with the inclination of slopes actually assumed
under the ordinary conditions of work.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>Friction is the chief cause of stability in granular soils
and those readily affected by moisture which have for
practical purposes no immutable cohesion. In few earths
are both cohesion and friction of considerable and reliable
value, one or the other quickly becoming impaired or
destroyed. Movement is caused by such various means that
each earth must be separately considered, and also the
circumstances under which it is placed. The particles of the
earth may be dissolved by water and become in a muddy
state, or they may be considered insoluble as in clean sand and
gravel, although in compact sand or gravel the cementing
material may crack and weather. Provided it was certain
any earth would always remain as originally formed, a
condition which it is impossible to guarantee in work, the
cohesion and frictional resistance being known, the correct
slope could be mathematically determined, but as all earths
are subject to varying deteriorating influences, such a
deduction is only valuable as a guide for reasonable inference.
Cohesion may be more quickly impaired by certain action
than friction, and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versâ</span></i>. Probably, of all soils, that to
be most distrusted is one that expands and contracts, such as
clay earth, which although possessing considerable cohesion
may become upon drying a mere congregation of disconnected
lumps ready to move upon the return of wet weather, thus
its considerable power of cohesion may practically be one of
the chief causes of a slip. On the contrary, clean sand,
although devoid of cohesion, will not crack or have a greasy
surface, but the particles may be washed away.</p>

<p class='c000'>To ascertain that any earth is uniformly affected throughout
the mass, and to prevent or provide against deteriorating
influences is the chief aim. It is useless to declare any
earth possesses considerable cohesion when the power can be
quickly dissipated by ordinary atmospheric action and even
become a cause of movement, and to rely for permanent
stability upon such property. In ordinary earths, not rock, it
will generally be found that cohesion is small or insignificant
in soil having a coefficient of friction of some moment, and
the reverse. In most earths friction, although it is affected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>in a greater degree by vibration, has to be relied upon, and
not cohesion, as the latter is variable and may exist almost
unimpaired in a lump, which nevertheless may become
detached because of fissures. The coefficients of friction of
different earths are also better known than the cohesion;
but how easily even friction is impaired may be gathered
from the sudden manner in which bridge cylinders will sink
after having hung for days by surface friction, or been held
by the transitory expansion of clay. Mr. Wilfrid Airy, B.A.,
in a series of experiments on the cohesion of earth, found
that in strong brick loam it is about 168 lbs. per square foot,
in compact clay and gravel it may reach 800 lbs. per square
foot of section, and in clean sand it is practically nihil.</p>

<p class='c000'>In rock the slope of repose depends whether the earth is
unstratified or stratified; and if stratified, upon the dip of
the strata and their resistance to the effects of the weather.
A vertical face may be stable in unstratified or stratified
rock, provided in the latter case it does not dip towards a
cutting; or the requisite slope may range from ¼ to 1 to such
an inclination that the cohesion and friction, which vary
greatly, are sufficient to prevent movement. In sidelong
ground should the rock dip parallel to the surface the hill
slope may require to be flat, whereas the valley slope may
stand vertically.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although, perhaps, in many instances the slopes of
cuttings and embankments have been arbitrarily fixed, it
may be said, on the whole, no very serious interruptions to
traffic have been caused from the <em>sole want of sufficient initial
flatness of a slope</em>, as that will soon become known. In
determining the inclination it is not the angle at which the
earth will stand at the time of excavation or deposition, and
for a few months after that is required to be ascertained, but
that which will <em>permanently</em> suffice to prevent movement. It
is well known that almost all freshly cut soil stands nearly
vertically for a small depth for a few days in ordinary
weather but then begins to crumble and finally break
away.</p>

<p class='c000'>What then will be the slope of permanent stability? This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>chiefly depends upon the degree of exposure, the effects of
the weather, water, and vibration upon the soil, and the
depth or height of a cutting or embankment.</p>

<p class='c000'>Each earth requires to be duly considered; for instance,
gravel and sand are pieces of rock, however small, and for
earthwork purposes the particles may be regarded as
insoluble in water; nevertheless in the case of sand, should
it be charged with water, it may be necessary to treat it as
a fluid, the same as mud, although water does not change
the particles; however, slips in cuttings and embankments
in sandy or gravelly soils are not usually caused by their
becoming gradually saturated throughout their mass, but by
a flow of water which creates water seams: the stability,
therefore, is dependent upon equal percolation and drainage
and protection of the surface; and the slope that should be
given to a sand cutting is also governed by the quantity of
water it will have to hold, and whether the sand is pure or
loamy. The depth of a cutting in sand has a considerable
influence upon the slope of stability, for frequently sand is
in a dry state in the upper portion of a cutting, but beneath
it is wet, and partakes more of a silty character, and therefore
may stand at a steeper inclination in the upper part, but
require a flat slope in the lower portion. The same conditions
are found in all soils, and the sides of a cutting vary,
one may be comparatively compact and free from water, the
other in a wet state and disintegrated. They will not
permanently repose at the same angle, the slope varying
according to the degree of dryness, size, and uniformity of
the particles. In all earths in which cohesion is liable to be
quickly destroyed, a straight slope is the best as having an
even surface, which prevents the formation of depressions
and causes the water to drain away, and also offers the least
surface to the weather. In all earth such as shingle, gravel,
or sand, consisting of pieces of rock or rubble, or having
round particles, it is important to remember that any
surface disturbance may cause serious movement, particularly
should it commence at the bottom of a slope, as then the
revolving action may not cease until a flatter inclination is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>produced by material rolling from the top and not reposing
until it nearly reaches the base. The quantity of moisture is
the chief governing condition of the slope of repose in clay
soils, and it should not be forgotten that this may vary considerably.
Clay when only slightly moist may stand at a
1 to 1 or 1½ to 1 slope, but as it gradually becomes in a wet
state will require a flatter inclination, and may not be at
rest until the slope is at least 3 to 1, and it is not safe to rely
upon a steeper slope than 3 to 1 in the case of almost any
surface clay beds liable to become charged with water, and
even 4 to 1, should the excavation be on the side of a clay
hill and near houses, or the ground be loaded; but clay
having some powers of cohesion which usually are greater as
the clay is harder, is not so quickly disintegrated as in the
case of more porous soil, and the form of the slope it assumes
is not a straight line; that most usually approached by sand
or gravel or a granular soil consisting of particles of the same
character, although the lower part of the slope may be
flattened consequent upon the erosion of the finer particles
which crumble and become deposited at the base.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a rule, the greater the cohesion of the soil the more
curved is its natural slope, the greatest pressure being at the
base where the inclination is flatter, and is steeper towards
the top, as the ground may be held together by cohesion at a
vertical face. The harder and looser the particles the
straighter will be the slope, and if the ground gradually
increases in firmness it will usually be nearly straight; but
if the contrary condition exists, the natural slope will be
flatter towards the base although nearly vertical for a few
feet from the top.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a proof how quickly clay becomes less stable and loses
its cohesive power with the usual quantity of moisture in it,
when first tipped it may assume a slope of 1 to 1 <span class='fss'>TO</span> 1½ to 1,
but upon exposure to the weather, which causes the lumps to
waste away and the clay to swell from moisture and other
agencies, the firmest clay in cuttings and embankments may
be said to be unstable until a slope of at least 1½ to 1 is
reached in moderate depths, and 2 to 1 <span class='fss'>TO</span> 3 to 1 in high
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>embankments or deep cuttings. In all earths the chief
cause of movement of earth is water, and the main questions
to be decided are so far as regards the inclination of the
slope.</p>

<p class='c000'>1. Should the surfaces of a cutting be drained and protected
and be excavated to a comparatively steep slope; or,</p>

<p class='c000'>2. Should they be left undrained and uncovered and be
excavated to a flat slope. Provided a cutting can be readily
drained and covered and there is no probability of any sudden or
permanent increase of moisture, perhaps the first method is
the more economical; but much depends upon the quantity
of water held by the earth in its normal state, whether it is
of the same character throughout, and the depth of a cutting.
Should the beds be upheaved or intermixed, then a flat slope
is necessary and no covering except a wall may make it
stable at a steep slope, and, for instance, should clay be
always in a semi-saturated condition, 3 to 1 is the least slope
at which it will permanently stand, and it will usually
require a more moderate inclination. A medium course to
adopt is that of varying the inclination of the slopes, the
steepest, of course, being at the top and the flattest towards
the toe; this is in accordance with the laws of pressure and
a mathematical investigation of the theoretically correct
slope, which nearly corresponds with the actual slope a
high embankment will assume when allowed to weather and
settle: for by varying the inclination of the slope the latter
becomes practically a curved line and approximates to that of
the curve of equilibrium. In almost all slips the surface
from which the fallen mass has become detached is curved,
the upper part being concave and the lower slightly convex,
the outline being caused from the upper portion falling,
the lower receiving it and being pressed outwards; however,
it may happen that the lower part of a slope has remained
intact, and only the upper slipped and become deposited
upon it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The varying slope system has recently been adopted by
Mr. Francis Fox, M. Inst. C.E., upon the Scarborough and
Whitby Railway, where an embankment about 90 feet in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>height in treacherous clay had slopes of 1½ to 1 for the
upper 30 feet in height, 2 to 1 for the middle 30 feet, and 3
to 1 for the bottom 30 feet. Formation width 28 feet. A
calculation of the insistent weight per square foot, without a
train, at stated heights gives the following results; taking
the weight of the earth at 0·055 of a ton a cubic foot, or
1½ ton a cubic yard, and assuming the worst case, that of
the earth for the width of the formation, viz., 28 feet, to act
simply as a column 1 foot square and the load as not being
distributed over the area of the entire base at any point.</p>

<p class='c014'>At the base of the upper 30 feet, 1½ to 1 slopes, it would be about 1·65
ton per square foot.</p>

<p class='c014'>At the base of the middle 30 feet, 2 to 1 slopes, it would be about 3·30
tons per square foot.</p>

<p class='c014'>At the base of the lower 30 feet, 3 to 1 slopes, it would be about 4·95
tons per square foot.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the weight of 1 foot lineal of the embankment is
taken and considered as equally distributed over the whole
area of the base at the 30 feet divisions, the strain per
square foot would be as follows:</p>

<p class='c014'>At the base of the upper 30 feet, 1½ to 1 slopes, about 1 ton per square
foot.</p>

<p class='c014'>At the base of the middle 30 feet, 2 to 1 slopes, about 1¾ ton per square
foot.</p>

<p class='c014'>At the base of the lower 30 feet, 3 to 1 slopes, about 2¼ tons per square
foot.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—The actual strain is probably approximate to a mean between
the two values, and is nearer the latter than the former.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is no reason why the varying slope system should
not be adopted in embankments of clay or soil having
considerable powers of cohesion, as the expense of trimming
the slopes is very little more than making them to a straight
line. To trim a slope to an elliptical, parabolic, or cycloidal
curve would be a needless refinement requiring a template;
moreover, the surface is better when it consists of straight
lines, provided that at the junction of any two inclinations
the point of meeting is sufficiently rounded to prevent a
lodgment of water. In cuttings in non-weathering tenacious
soil the upper part might be left at a steep slope for 5 or 6
feet from the surface of the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>It is evident that the depth of a cutting or the height of
an embankment affects the stability of the slopes, but some
soils are so weak that an embankment of even little height
will not be at rest until the toe of the slope is supported.
If the slopes were not pressed out the earth in the central
portion of an embankment would stand at any weight less
than that which would crush it when in its weakest
condition; therefore, as the load increases downwards it is a
logical deduction that the slope should be flatter as it
approaches the base. In slips the form generally assumed in
soils having considerable cohesive power nearly approaches
that of a parabolic curve, which shows that a straight slope
is not the correct one in tenacious soil, and theory confirms
it.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the case of cuttings of considerable depth, apart from
the question of the best form of slope, in order to lessen the
velocity of the surface water and the extent of a slip, and
cause supported weight upon the slopes, they can be divided
by broad terraces or benchings, about 6 feet in width, and at
vertical distances of 15 to 20 feet, upon which can be
impermeable catchwater drains. It is important not to
allow a flow in a straight line or nearly so, as the velocity of
the water may erode the slope. If the nature of the earth
and its resistance to erosion will allow, the benches or steps
should be abrupt, in order to cause the greatest resistance
and deviation from a direct discharge. The slopes of the
catchwater drains may require to be covered in a flood
district or one having a heavy rain or snowfall.—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vide</span></i>
Chapter IV.</p>

<p class='c000'>In excavating a cutting in soil likely to slip, care should
be taken that the surfaces are not strained by lumps being
left upon them which are only retained by reason of the
cohesion of the earth, as they will cause weak places less
able to bear any pressure brought upon the slopes through
the sides being deprived of continuity of support. Therefore,
in such cases, the slopes should always be rough trimmed as
quickly as possible after the gullet has been excavated.
Also when the slope of a cutting is furrowed so that its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>surface consists of separate and unsupported masses of earth
clinging to it, continuity of support is destroyed and the
earth is more exposed to meteorological dissipation; and in
non-cohesive soils such as sandy or gravelly earth, in which
especially a straight and uncut surface is of importance,
movement is incited. Therefore, when it is found necessary
to insert open trenches in a slope, they should be at right
angles to its foot, and the inserted material should be well
packed so as to support the sides and to interfere as little as
possible with the slope. Even in clay soils or any having
considerable cohesion, trenches <em>diagonally or transversely</em> cut
in the surface are generally inexpedient as disturbing and
destroying the continuity of support of the surface and
increasing its exposure to the action of the weather; and
although they may be temporarily effectual as drains, such
division of the inclined face cannot but induce a disunited
condition which will at once be apparent should the trench
become choked and it miscarry as a drain; and a temporary
failure may so destroy the existing delicate equilibrium as to
cause movement. Such trenches should be regarded with
suspicion, as any stability caused by their draining or
conducting away water may be effected at the cost of
continuity of support, the deterioration of the resistance of
the soil to weather, and the impairment of its frictional and
cohesive properties. If placed upon a slope at right angles
to the formation the preceding objections are removed.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may become necessary to excavate or trim a slope to a
steeper inclination than that which would otherwise be
adopted and is considered to be its angle of repose, in order
to widen a railway between the fences, or enlarge a station.
Then, pre-eminently the question of the effects of a slip
demand attention. The great majority of railway stations
are located prior to the commencement of, or as the works
progress, but additional accommodation which, for reasons of
economy must proceed <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pari passu</span></i> with the development of a
district, is usually required some time after a railway has
been opened for public traffic, and it may be imperatively
necessary to confine the works within the boundaries of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>land originally purchased. Consideration of the several
chapters in this book will recall to the mind the chief points
to be regarded. Fortunately, stations are seldom placed in
deep cuttings or upon high embankments; but frequently
when a station is opened, houses will be erected around it,
thus causing any movement of the ground to be of serious
moment and dangerous. Assuming the railway must be
widened within the original fences, the position of the toe of
the slope is fixed, and also that of the top of the slope. The
questions then in the case of a cutting are principally:—</p>

<p class='c000'>1. Will the slope be too precipitous for the earth to stand
at one inclination?</p>

<p class='c000'>2. Can it be made sufficiently steep for 5 or 6 feet from
the top to obtain an inclination for the lower portion at
which it will have permanent stability?</p>

<p class='c000'>3. Can the earth be made to repose if the face is evenly
protected under circumstances 1 and 2?</p>

<p class='c000'>4. Is it necessary to erect a retaining wall to a distance
a few feet from the original surface of the ground?</p>

<p class='c000'>5. If a wall be necessary, what should be its lowest height
consistent with the stability of the unsupported inclined
earth above it?</p>

<p class='c000'>Provided there is no appreciable superincumbent weight
to be borne nearer than 10 feet from the top of the slope,
and that the foundations of a building are at a considerable
depth in the ground, and the surface and back drainage
waters properly controlled, no retaining wall may be
required, assuming the original inclination under ordinary
conditions to be proved to be the permanent slope of
stability; but should the distance of the face of a building
from the toe of the slope after widening be insufficient to
allow of the original slope being adopted, a retaining wall
will be necessary, its height being chiefly governed by the
proximity of any building, and the necessity of nearly maintaining
the originally established steepest slope of repose in
the case of any unsupported earth. The advantage of a
sufficient cess in such a case is that it makes provision
against deterioration of the surface, and causes an imaginary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>slope of the same inclination as the original slope to be
contained within the space between the face of the building
and that of the retaining wall at formation level. In sandy
or loose soil if any buildings or wells near the site show
signs of cracking, the excavation should at once be stopped
to see what preventive measures are requisite, and pumping
water out of a trench may be dangerous. Any retaining
wall in such a position should be erected in short lengths, so
that the earth and foundations are exposed to the weather as
little as practicable.</p>

Methods of Covering and Supporting a Slope.—Protection
from Snow-Drifts.—The Formation Width of Cuttings and
Embankments.—The Deleterious Effects of Vibration.</span></p>

<p class='c005'>The protection of the toe of a slope is of importance, as it is
usually the most vulnerable and the weakest part. When the
earth is of the same character, the quantity of water is
usually greater at the lowest level than above it, and the
stability of the soil in its vicinity is therefore lessened. In
clay soils this softening action at the base may cause a slip
and probably can only be prevented by reducing the
percolation by surface drainage, which has been referred to
in Chapter IV.; the matter under consideration being the
counteraction of movement in the toe by other means than
draining, although combined with it, such as by—</p>

<p class='c000'>1. An impervious retaining wall with a pervious backing
of ashes, gravel or sand, and ample weep-holes, at the foot of
a slope, which, by preference, should be of Portland cement
concrete, a more homogeneous material than brickwork or
masonry, as it has no joints, and is particularly to be preferred
for retaining walls in clay soils, as it approaches in a
greater degree the condition of air-tightness and that of equal
resistance.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. By a pervious wall or counterfort of gravel, burnt
ballast, hard chalk, rubble, strutted timber framework, or a
covering of other firm material.</p>

<p class='c000'>In both the preceding cases, to ensure stability and to
prevent any protective works being pushed forward, the
foundations must be below the formation or ground level.
To lessen sliding action the foundation should incline at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>right angles to the face, and should have a batter either for
the whole width or for a distance not less than about one-third
to one-half of the bottom thickness in the case of
low retaining walls. A wall having a steep batter upon
each face, and therefore a wide base as compared with
its area, causes the centre of gravity to be at a greater
distance from the exposed face, and therefore the resistance
to overturning is increased; but care must be taken that it
does not slide forward. A foundation for such a wall upon
clay or tenacious soil is to be preferred, provided there is no
upheaval of the ground in front, but it should not be upon a
thin stratum, or the latter may slide upon another.</p>

<p class='c000'>In towns, or where land is of considerable value, the two
sides of a cutting can be made to support each other, and one
of the following principal methods may be adopted.</p>

<p class='c000'>1. An invert under the line.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. A heavy flat platform, arched on plan or solid throughout,
under the permanent way or formation, to prevent a
forward movement of the toe.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. Overhead arches and iron struts at intervals to resist
and reduce the pressure upon a wall.</p>

<p class='c000'>In such a situation, should a tunnel or covered way be not
required, any subsidence of the earth may cause the destruction
of valuable property, and the erection of a retaining
wall be imperatively necessary from a due consideration of
prudential construction, and altogether regardless of the
character or condition of the earth or its liability to become
water-charged. In order to prevent movement of the earth
different forms of support may be required. In some cases,
owing to excessive pressure, a counterforted wall with an
invert under the permanent way may be essential, or the
invert may be flat and be arched on plan, thus supporting
the toe of a retaining wall between the intervals, in combination
with a vertical or inclined pilaster and a front
counterfort system, and in addition flat overhead struts of
iron or other material between the walls acting as an
auxiliary support above the required traffic space may have
to be adopted where the walls have to sustain considerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>thrust, the thickness of the retaining wall being thus
reduced; or a simple retaining wall may be sufficient. A
non-jointed material as Portland cement concrete of equal
character is to be preferred to a mass consisting of hard
materials yet incapable of possessing a joint equal to their
strength or durability.</p>

<p class='c000'>With regard to the protection of the toe or lower portion,
of a slope by means of a retaining wall, it may be the only
effectual support in one case, and not succeed in an exposed
country without a complete system of open or closed drains,
and then its adoption may be superfluous. In the following
few paragraphs an endeavour is made to indicate some
situations in which retaining walls have or have not been
completely successful when erected for such purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>First, it is most important that ample provision be made
for draining the back of the walls, for if the egression of the
surface waters be obstructed, they must accumulate and
cause hydrostatic pressure, soften the lower portion of the
earth, thereby failing to partly effect one of the objects of
their erection, and cease to protect the surface; the probable
result being that the wall is pushed forward, broken up, or
overturned. The drainage must be regulated by the quantity
and velocity of the flow, and ample weep-holes should be
provided to prevent an accumulation of water at the back.
In damp soil there should be one to about every three or four
superficial yards, and an outlet at each wet place, or a wall
may not stand. The wall should be backed with a filtering
medium such as coarse gravel, hard ashes, ballast, and no
retentive earth should be used. In clay earths a retaining
wall should always have a dry porous backing, as it not only
reduces any pressure due to a head of water, but also allows
of the earth swelling without affecting the stability of the
wall, as it probably would if the clay rested against the back
of the wall.</p>

<p class='c000'>Retaining or breast walls are particularly useful in loose
soil having no cohesion, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>, those of a sandy character or
consisting of very small grains, and which upon saturation
by water or by the action of its flow become in an unstable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>state or one of actual movement; in such, a case not only is it
requisite to protect the surface of a slope, but support at the
toe is indispensable. In cohesive soil, such as clay or clay
marls, surface protection, combined with systematic and
thorough drainage, may be all that is required to make a
slope stable, and the erection of an impervious or solid high
wall be unnecessary, always provided the earth cannot slide
from being superimposed upon an inclined stratum. In fact,
retaining walls in retentive soil have been found to induce a
slip, because they neither drain the earth nor prevent the
additional impregnation of water, and they have consequently
been destroyed.</p>

<p class='c000'>In countries where floods or very heavy and sudden rainfall,
frost and snow quickly succeed, masonry or dry stone
retaining walls at the foot of a slope soon become impaired,
and require constant supervision and careful maintenance,
and cannot be considered as economically or generally
effectual; and should the earth settle, as they are comparatively
solid they will not follow any subsidence of the
surface; therefore cracks occur and water accumulates in the
hollows, the slope has no longer uniform support, a localization
of the egression of water is caused, owing to the fissures
in the wall inducing a flow, and the wall becomes a cause of
a slip instead of a protection against movement. Should
such a wall bulge after it has been restored to the condition
of being a continuous support, its forward movement may be
arrested by the erection of counterforts with an inclined
face in front from 10 to 30 feet apart according as weak
places exist, having joints at right angles to the batter; and
this is, perhaps, the cheapest and quickest remedy, but the
slope must be carefully drained and the number of weep-holes
be increased.</p>

<p class='c000'>In order not to obstruct, but induce the through drainage
of water, retaining walls to prevent slips have been erected,
consisting of arches turned upon piers, the intervening space
being dry walling which allows a free flow of water, the
idea being to afford the necessary support without interfering
with the drainage. In some cases, as it tends to condense
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>the soil, weighting the toe of the slope may prevent movement,
and on the side of a hill weight and mass, apart from
slope protection or drainage, must be provided to arrest a
slip or prevent further movement, either by means of a
continuous wall, or by the addition of frequent counterforts,
5 or 6 feet in width, to an existing wall, if space permits,
the back and front having a considerable batter: the centre
of gravity of such a mass being low and the base large, overturning
is improbable. Forward movement can be also
guarded against by deep foundations, and as the earth will
rest on the inside they can have a flatly inclined base
sloping towards the cutting, as it will tend to prevent overturning,
the depth of the foundations at the face being two
or three times that at the back. Such a structure can hardly
be called a wall, being really an extensive and massive
concrete toe.</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps generally the most economical and secure way of
preventing movement is to erect a low Portland cement
concrete wall at the toe of a slope with a considerable
batter; or to cut a trench at formation level outside the line
of the slope, and to shore it by means of old sleepers strutted
at intervals when better and durable material cannot be
readily obtained.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chief object of a protection at the toe in clay soils is
to prevent the bottom of a slope being softened by a lodgment
of water, or fissured by heat or drought; this may be
effected without a wall; but in the case of sand or fine
granular earth cuttings liable to become quicksand, support
at the base is absolutely necessary, and the best way to
prevent movement may be to erect a breast retaining wall at
the toe a few feet in height, say 3 to 5 feet, the backing
being of dry porous material such as ashes, coarse gravel, or
broken stone, increasing according to the depth or height of
the earthwork and quantity of water, the thickness being
more than sufficient to contain the drainage waters, and not
less than 1 foot 6 inches, in order that it may act as a filter
and drain the slope, &amp;c., so as to lessen the percolation of
water. Sheet-piling and a backing of rubble acting as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>drain 2 or 3 feet square, or a strutted timber duct, both
made out of old sleepers, have been used with this object in
quicksand where water rapidly percolated to and accumulated
at the base. Instability of the toe may also be prevented by
covering it with layers of gravel, but one of the reasons
that may cause a gravel counterfort to fail in loose porous
soil is that sand or mould may be washed through the
interstices in the stones forming the gravel; hence a more
impermeable covering is to be recommended in such a case.</p>

<p class='c000'>A toe of rammed coarse gravel or broken stone may
supply the required support in the case of coarse and fine
sand, when the latter is alone movable. Experiments have
shown that sand rammed in layers of about 5 inches and
earth mould 2 inches in thickness give the best results.
The less the weight is increased by ramming the more solid
the original earth. Brushwood or fascine work weighted
with gravel, stone or broken bricks, and stone pitching can
also be used for sandy soils, but a filtering layer must cover
the sand, or the latter will be eroded. Counterforts of well-rammed
natural earth may be sufficient provided the soil is
firm and is made compact and uniform in texture. In
otherwise stable soil, when it is known that a sand vein is
the cause of a slip because of water percolating through it,
it should be raked out as deeply as practicable if not too
large, and the space be filled with stones, coarse gravel, or
dry material forming an open drain for the water to issue
without a flow of sand, thereby preventing any accumulation.
When a stratum of shifting sand overlies beds of conglomerate
and gravelly or clayey sand it will be necessary to
support the lower portion of its slope by a wall. The
wettest places in a slope should be noted and the surface be
turfed or covered, and should the depth of the unstable sand
exceed 5 or 6 feet, narrow benchings can be made 2 or 3 feet
in width at every 5 or 6 feet of vertical height to divide the
flow of water and prevent it following a continuous course.
It also sometimes happens that two treacherous earths have
a stratum of stable soil between them such as rock; in that
event it is advisable to leave a cess between the bottom of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>the slope of the upper stratum of unstable soil and the
underlying rock, so as to allow of weighting or other works
to resist movement of the toe.</p>

is made to them as drains, and in Chapter VI., pages <a href='#Page_111'>111</a>,
<a href='#Page_112'>112</a>, an objection is examined; but they are generally
effective if cut at right angles to the formation and not
diagonally or transversely. When a slip is repaired by
replacing the slipped earth when dried and rammed between
such drains, it should be determined whether it would be
better to cover the slope or increase the number of drainage
channels. A simpler remedy is the insertion of a dry
rubble lining on the surface of the original ground upon
which a slip has occurred, and the restoration of the slope by
means of firm earth or rammed and dried slipped soil; but
the system of rammed earth counterforts, although it has
succeeded when effected during the dry season, the earth being
wetted sufficiently to make it cohesive by ramming, will
not succeed in wet or winter weather, as the soil cannot then
be consolidated by ramming operations, for it will be overcharged
with water from the effects of rain, frost, or snow.
Fair or summer weather is required to ensure success.</p>

<p class='c000'>Should it be considered advisable, in addition to the erection
of rammed earth counterforts to a height of from one-third
to one-half of that of an embankment, a porous layer or wall
of broken stone can be inserted between the slipped material,
which is not touched, so that the waters can filter away
through it and the slope be restored; and the counterfort
have a channel at its base, in order to prevent a lodgment of
water, to drain the slipped earth and the embankment, and
to prevent the counterfort becoming saturated. This
method may be insufficient in any but comparatively firm
soil, and it may be necessary to make a trench at the toe of
the slope having its base 2 or 3 feet below the seat of the
slip or firm ground, it being filled with rock chippings,
shingle, gravel, burnt ballast, broken bricks, ashes, coarse
clean sand, or other material having equable frictional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>stability and particles that may for earthwork purposes be
considered as insoluble in water, and therefore that form
stable masses and yet act as drains; and to drain the slopes
by trenches varying in width according to the position and
depth of cutting, the depth of a trench may be little or have
to be such that it extends to the solid ground through the
slip, or about 50 to 75 per cent. of its depth, which must be
determined in each case, may be sufficient. Such dry stone
counterforts may be required at distances from centre to
centre of 15 to 66 feet, and are sometimes placed in the same
right line and even through an embankment, and are connected
with a drain sufficiently deep to prevent any lodgment
of water at the centre of the base of the embankment or
near the foot of a slope.</p>

<p class='c000'>With regard to covering a slope of a cutting or embankment,
its principal use is to lessen deterioration from
meteorological action, to keep the ground underneath in an
equable condition, to reduce percolation and make it
uniform, to diminish the danger arising from cracks and
fissures caused by heat, evaporation, or drought, to prevent
the erosion of the surface by a flow of water or the
production of unctuous surfaces, and yet not interfere with
effectual drainage.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is known that percolation is decreased by vegetation,
and that it is less through turf than bare ground, but varies
greatly according to the kind of covering, the season of the
year, the regular or irregular distribution of the rainfall, and
other causes. If the surface has to be covered with vegetation
it should be close, uniform, and vigorous throughout the
whole year, and nothing fulfils these conditions as well as
grass or turf. The protecting value of turfing earthwork
may be judged from an inspection of fortifications in which
steep slopes, deep ditches, and perfect maintenance are a
necessity. As a consequence of the binding and shielding of
the earth by the roots of grasses and plants, and their
protection of the surface, the slopes stand at a steeper
inclination than they otherwise would, and the system of
clinching the exposed faces of the parapets of earthwork
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>with a layer of sods laid header and stretcher is found to be
a great support.</p>

<p class='c000'>In earth possessing considerable cohesion, such as the clays,
provided the covering is uniform, grass having comparatively
deep roots is not a particular advantage, but the closeness of
the growth of the plant and the unimpaired maintenance of
a complete cover is of importance, and the earth should be
disturbed as little as possible so as to prevent any particles
comprising the soil becoming disintegrated and dissolved.
When it is considered advisable to adopt a covering of grass,
plants, shrubs, or trees, it should be remembered that some
grasses, such as the couch-grass, are injurious to other plants.
To equally cover a slope with sods of turf they should be cut
to a regular form and depth of about 6 inches, and be firmly
pressed into their places so as to produce an even smooth
surface. A steep slope or any less than 1 to 1, if of considerable
depth, will not give a sufficiently flat surface for grass
to properly grow upon it.</p>

<p class='c000'>In sandy and gravelly ground, as the particles may be
considered insoluble in water and as possessing no cohesion,
grass, if it will grow, having deep roots is to be preferred,
even if passing through any earth that has been placed upon
a slope, in order to counteract the want of cohesion by a
greater hold in the soil and any peeling of the turf or tufts
forming or becoming detached, rolling down and leaving an
unbared surface. Bent-grass will usually grow on most
sandy soils, and a shrub known on the north-east coast of
England as the sea buckthorn also rapidly vegetates, but
marine grasses must be used in ground impregnated with
brackish or sea water. To prevent light sand from being
scattered by the wind or washed away a species of rush
(Bot. <em>Ammophila arundinacea</em>) has been used in Holland
and England, and is found to flourish in dry soils, and as it
has spreading roots which often grow to a length of 20 feet
or more it binds the grains of sand. Experience in Holland
has shown that grass upon sea embankments does not grow
well or flourish at a steeper slope than about 6 to 1.</p>

<p class='c000'>In countries where wind storms occur, or the soil is of so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>light a character that the passage of a train at considerable
speed raises the earth and moves it as dust, a covering of fine
grass indigenous to the country has been found to be
a protection and necessary to economical maintenance.
Planting the white basket willow, or withy, has been
recommended as a means of preventing slips in loose soil,
as the roots form a network and bind the earth and cover the
surface with shrub growth. In damp ground the cuttings
need not be planted as deeply as in dry earth, but of course
they will not flourish in all soils. Osiers have also been
adopted with good results in damp places.</p>

<p class='c000'>Embankments of blown or drift sand, easily moved by the
wind, have also been protected and maintained by branches
of trees laid horizontally. They were placed in regular
courses alternately with a stratum of sand, the ends projecting
over and down the slopes, which were sown with
indigenous plants that it is known will flourish upon it.
Great difficulty had been experienced in maintaining the
embankment until its surface was so shielded. Sandy dunes
have also been prevented from slipping and being eroded and
destroyed by the sea and wind by reducing them to the same
line, level, and slope, by filling all openings or depressions,
or, if curved, by trimming them to a regular exterior and
the largest radius, and by a covering of fascine work in the
exposed places, and in any less exposed situation by planting
them with grasses that will grow upon such soil, the
object being to remove all local obstruction to wind or wave
force and cause equable resistance and protection. In
France, the drifting of blown sea-sand into cuttings, which
not only may interfere with the free traffic but also be a
destructive agent to the rolling stock, has been prevented by
planting pine trees upon the cess.</p>

<p class='c000'>In embankments in loose soil and across valleys, especially
if they are narrow and deep, repeated gusts of wind which
have their maximum effect upon a flat surface at right angles
to it, will produce a hammering action upon the windward
side, and when the velocity is very great, upon the leeward
portion there may even be a partial vacuum created by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>wind rushing over the top of an embankment. An actual
maximum momentary pressure of wind of 80 lbs. per square
foot was registered at the Liverpool Observatory in 1869,
equal to a hammering action of 0·55 lb. per square inch.
It is here referred to in order to show that in exposed valleys
the surface of all embankments of light soil should be
covered so that the particles cannot be blown away at the
top or from the slopes, for a force of 80 lbs. per square foot
nearly equals the weight of a cubic foot of dry open sand
which cannot be taken as weighing much more than 90 to
100 lbs.</p>

<p class='c000'>If seed be sown upon a slope it is evident that it should
be of uniform kind in order to create a general equable
condition, and the growth of all rank vegetation should be
prevented, for an unevenly protected or covered surface will
promote a localization of disturbing agencies, and especially
in treacherous ground when it has been covered, neither the
surface nor the turf should be allowed to be broken.</p>

<p class='c000'>In ordinary cases where slips may be expected, soiling with
mould or top dressing, and sowing the slopes may be sufficient,
and turfing in others of small extent; but in retentive
soluble soil, a filtering layer under the turf may be required,
so as to prevent spreading, particularly near the toe of a
slope; however, in mountainous or hilly districts, experience
seems to indicate that it is advisable to allow earthwork to
become consolidated by the natural effect of rain and
atmosphere before finally trimming or covering the slopes:
on the contrary it may be advisable, especially in treacherous
ground, to trim and cover with mould, sow, turf, plant, or
cover the slopes as soon as possible after they are excavated
or deposited, in order to protect soluble soil from rain, frost,
or snowstorms consequent upon the wet season being near.
Of course, when experience shows that slips are improbable,
the slopes can remain bare and simply be trimmed, and a
covering of grass be left to time to effect, and this is now the
frequent practice. Should settlement be expected or be
unavoidable, the face protection can be so made that it will
not be disturbed or broken. In such a case a short, straight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>slope with a flat inclined berm or cess, the length of the slope
being divided into three or four short continuous straight
portions, has been adopted with success. Should sowing or
planting the slopes be considered as too slow in producing a
covering, experiments can be made by mixing available soils,
or with one earth; and by exposing the mixture or earth to
the deteriorating weather influences it will have to resist,
the best protective covering to be readily obtained can be
discovered.</p>

<p class='c000'>Respecting the planting of saplings or shrubs, laws have
been enacted to compel the planting of saplings and trees
upon certain lands as a protection against landslips, and it
seems to be generally acknowledged that trees, particularly
when in plantations, are a protection, as they not only absorb
moisture and bind the earth with their roots, but also lessen
any flow of water down the steep sides of a cutting or
embankment; and instances have been recorded in which
trees have been shown to preserve the alluvial banks of
rivers, as when they were felled the sides were eroded, or
weakened, probably by the increase of moisture and
exposure, with the result that the channel became widened.
The systematic planting of live slips of poplar or willow has
been found to effectually protect soft banks of rivers, washed
by the stream, against weathering and erosion. Also in
treacherous clay marly-soils, in which slips of earth were
numerous, acacia trees have afforded a good protection, as
their widely spreading roots conduced to hold the soil
together, and their foliage and branches gently regulated
and lessened the effects of rain and prevented quick infiltration
into the earth. However, care must be taken that
the roots do not open or strain the surface of the ground by
force of the wind or otherwise, and increase and localize
percolation; but they tend to prevent cracking and fissuring
of the surface in clay and argillaceous earth, and form a
protection against the effects of the sun’s rays and drought.
Quick-growing trees should be selected having large and deep
roots and abundant foliage, especially in non-cohesive earths.
Acacia and birch trees appear to give satisfactory results.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>Unless in exceptional situations, such as to protect a cutting
from drifts of snow, or where from local experience they are
proved to act upon the earth as a holdfast, it is questionable
whether the indiscriminate and non-systematic planting of
saplings or bushes is not more likely to aid disruption than
promote stability, and, as a rule, other and less expensive
means of protecting a slope are to be preferred unless a
uniform covering by trees or shrubs is practicable, whether
over a small or large unstable area. Isolated trees should
not be allowed within the fences of a cutting, although if just
outside the toe of the slope of an embankment the roots may
serve as a buttress, and therefore be beneficial. Although
in some dyke embankments in North Europe no trees or
plants are allowed to grow upon them, so that any deterioration
of the mass maybe clearly and quickly apparent; in
Holland the defensive covering varies according to the
character of the earth, fascines, wattling, sodding, a gravel
coating, benching at the top of a slope and planting it with
reeds to protect an embankment from erosion and wash
caused by traffic; pitching, plank facing, and sheet planking
at the toe, when the ground is very soft, have all been used
with success. On silty land willows generally grow rapidly,
and when planted a little distance from the toe of the land
slope in enclosure embankments they are found to protect the
ground. In some situations it may be necessary to protect
an embankment against boring by burrowing animals or
crustacea. Clay and clay loams are soils especially liable to
be burrowed. Usually as the quantity of sand increases, the
boring decreases; a coating of hard ashes may afford the
required protection: however, in the case of crustacea, local
experience alone can indicate the best protection, probably
nothing less than stone pitching may suffice, but as a general
rule in this country, no precautions are necessary; in
warmer regions it may be otherwise.</p>

<p class='c000'>With reference to fissures in a slope which tend to produce
slips as they allow water to trickle down them, which must
either be absorbed by the earth or find an outlet; a slippery
surface is thus created and the tenacity and continuity of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>the soil impaired or destroyed; separation also takes place
in non-homogeneous earths such as boulder clay and in
embankments formed of rock and earth tipped together. It
is practically impossible to fill or pun every fissure that may
appear in a cutting or an embankment, but as there are
generally places where slips are more probable than others,
it may be advantageous in treacherous soils to adopt a
regular system of filling the fissures, especially before the
wet season commences.</p>

<p class='c000'>Coverings can also be made of a thin coating of burnt
ballast, hard chalk, or gravel, which will reduce the number
of cracks or crevices, or a mattress of fascine work can be
used at the toe of the slope in submerged work, but care
should be taken that the mattresses overlap and that there
are no open places between them, or, instead of being a
protection they will then be a source of danger by conducting
water between the joints; for this reason, as with any other
material having loose openings, it is advisable to use them
over a continuous surface so that percolation may be
uniform and not simply for weak places or for the purpose of
repairing a slip in an earth embankment. The chief aim in
fascine work is to thoroughly bind the work together so that
it is of equal strength in all directions, and a little time after
construction should be allowed before deposition in order
that the material may settle, as an even surface is important.
The most durable material should be used in making a
fascine covering, willow being the best, or it may require
constant renewing. Alder, aspen, and the best available
brushwood are also employed, and straw and ordinary
matting for shallow embankments, say up to 8 feet in height,
which lasts only six to twelve months. The best time for cutting
should be locally ascertained, and when they commence
to deteriorate after being hewn, generally from three months to
a year, depending upon the season in which they are cut, &amp;c.,
&amp;c. In England, thorn switches have been used in lengths
of 5 to 6 feet, tied up with tarred rope in bundles having
a diameter of about 1 foot, every endeavour being made
to bind and interweave them. Care must be taken that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>the mattresses are well loaded or they will float; the loading
should commence at the centre, and be equally continued in
all directions, as that has been found to be the best method;
they should be made to sink evenly if they have to be
lowered through water, and they must be prevented from
curling up at the edges. The props which fix them must
not be too close to the border, or near the centre, as then the
extremities will be torn away or bent upwards. The system
of fascine work may be very useful for protecting sandy and
soft foundations in such situations, to prevent slips in the
slopes of an embankment and in providing a firm bed, and
also for making training banks, groynes, and spurs, for
correcting and directing a current in a desired channel, and
to secure freedom from slips in a river-bank. Depending
upon the degree of looseness of the sand or sandy bed, loaded
fascine mattresses will assume a slope of from 1 to 1 <span class='fss'>TO</span> 5 to 1
if allowed to sink in the bed, and after they have settled and
reached the angle of repose which the action of water will
effect; the large number of structures standing upon them
for many years in considerable depths of water proves, when
they are properly made, that they are to be trusted in
comparatively unexposed situations.</p>

<p class='c000'>A covering of stone pitching may be necessary, but in unsubmerged
work it has some disadvantages for, having joints,
it allows unequal penetration of water through them and
impedes the equal discharge of water from the earth, although
its weight is a recommendation as it opposes and may balance
a pressure of water behind the slope. However, unless it is
bedded upon a layer of soil of equal permeability, such as
gravel laid upon a nearly impermeable bed of clay, which
should always be mixed with sand to prevent it fissuring and
bursting by heat or water, so as to convey the water that has
percolated and also that which exudes through the slope; it
may cause a localization of the flow, and, except in peculiar
cases and provided the slopes are covered, there is no occasion
for pitching if merely used to prevent slips and not erosion,
as obviously weight and a secure protection may be obtained
by other means and at less expense. For the protection of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>the slopes of rivers or canals or submerged work the case is
different, as then pitching prevents erosion and may be the
only secure preservative in exposed situations, although
generally the most expensive. The pitching should rest
upon a bed of permeable material, and this layer should have
a power of suction and distribution more than equal to the
quantity of water that may penetrate the joints of the
pitching; there should be a bed of impermeable material
next to the soil, and in exceptional cases even two to carry off
any water that has percolated, so as to obviate any lodgment
of water, due provision being made for the land drainage
discharge.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir James Brunlees, Past-President Inst. C.E., found by
experiment that at a slope of 2 to 1 pitching has the greatest
resistance to extraction, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>, it requires a greater effort to
extract a brick at that slope. Taking the slope of 2 to 1 as
unity, the relative resistances were found to be as follows:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1 to 1 slope 0·71</div>
      <div class='line'>2 to 1 slope 1·00</div>
      <div class='line'>3 to 1 slope 0·97</div>
      <div class='line'>4 to 1 slope 0·66</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The resistances at 2 to 1 and 3 to 1 are practically the
same.</p>

<p class='c000'>Should it be determined to pitch the lower part only of a
slope, in order to prevent slips, the pitching must continue to
such a height that a flow of water down the slope is impossible,
or it may become detached. If the pitching is not
rough squared on the joints, but of various forms, it is
preferable that the face having the largest area be laid
downwards, smaller stones being carefully wedged in
between the interstices. Any defective execution is usually
followed by a falling of the stones, and should this happen
the surface will be broken and erosion and slips will ensue.
In laying the stones they should be so placed that if a few
become removed those above or upon the sides will not be
disturbed, and in loose soil no pitching should be laid until
an embankment has had time to settle and consolidate, which
the necessities of rapid execution may prevent, for however
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>even the pitching may be when first laid, it will settle and
become more or less uneven in such soil as sand or estuary
slake, and every effort should be made to leave no hole or
exposed surface, but to cause a continuous close covering.
Fascine mattresses may have to be used in such a situation, as
they will follow the contour of the slope. Should the slope
be subject to considerable wave action, smooth surfaces offering
the least frictional resistance, obviously aid the travel of
a wave, which is undesirable, and provided the embankment
is sufficiently strong a rougher surface is to be desired.
Projecting stakes tend to subdivide a wave.</p>

<p class='c000'>Should pitching be required to be placed partly upon the
face of a cutting and partly upon the slope of an embankment,
as in the case of a canal upon sidelong ground, care
must be taken that it does not settle unequally, and provision
should be made by setting it upon a pervious layer, so that
any damming back of drainage waters may be prevented.
The weight of pitching upon a slope affords a counter-pressure
to that of any water in the slopes which may be
trying to emerge. Chalk rubble, also hard chalk, or gravel
has been used in lieu of stone pitching for protecting slopes
against erosion.</p>

<p class='c000'>With the exception of retaining walls, the preceding may
be considered as the principal means, used separately or in
reasonable combination, for covering the surface of a slope in
a cutting or an embankment.</p>

<p class='c000'>A frequent cause of instability of the slopes in countries
having severe winters is the melting of unequal masses of
snow, the result of drifts, and also from the thawing of a
considerable snowfall. The chief preventive measures
against snowdrifts and consequent protection to the slopes,
although not a covering, may be stated to be as follows:—</p>

<p class='c000'>1. Locate the line in a naturally sheltered position, which
it is most improbable can be done throughout its length.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. Adopt tunnels, covered or sheltered galleries where the
district is subject to avalanches or snow-slips.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. Prevent drifts by permanent or portable screens such as
earth mounds, trees, hedges, fences, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>4. Obstruct drifts by having deep trenches some distance
from the top of the slopes.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. Avoid cuttings as much as possible, and make the line
upon an embankment of such a height as to be above the
depth of the drift snow in similar situations.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. Construct the embankments from side cutting, instead
of cutting, so that the trenches may catch the snow before
it reaches the railway.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. Make the slope much flatter than its angle of repose.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. Increase the width of the formation so as to lessen the
depth of a drift, and to enable a snow-plough to more readily
discharge its excavation.</p>

<p class='c000'>With regard to the preventive measures enumerated.</p>

<p class='c000'>No. 1.—As a rule this can only be practised to a limited
extent consequent upon traffic requirements and the configuration
of the country.</p>

<p class='c000'>No. 2.—Shelter-galleries are found to be generally effectual,
but obviously are expensive; they may, however, be the only
means to adopt, as any obstruction to a snow-slip is avoided.
The slope of the top of a covered or shelter-gallery should
not be steeper than that of the hill, so as to offer no impediment
to the free passage of the snow.</p>

<p class='c000'>No. 3.—Experience has proved that permanent screens are
to be preferred to portable shields, and that ultimately they
are the more economical. The excavated material, either
from a cutting, drains or fence-ditches, is generally used for
the earth mounds so as to save expense; their height, which
is often from 7 to 10 feet, of course is governed by the
greatest depth of the snowfall, degree of exposure and usual
direction of storms, wind, and drift. Should these vary
much, in an open air line it may be impracticable to entirely
shut out or prevent drifts, but the protective works will
lessen drifting and may reduce it to manageable proportions.</p>

<p class='c000'>A simple earth dam is seldom sufficient, owing to the
impelling power of the wind upon the snow-flakes and the
considerable height at which it acts; therefore, fencing has
been fixed in the top of the mound, or trees and shrubs
planted, also old sleepers have been successful when simply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>closely driven into the surface of the original ground. A
screen, consisting of one or more rows of trees or shrubs
placed at a little distance from the top of the slope of a
cutting, is that most generally preferred. It is made either
double or single, as may be thought necessary. In Germany,
hedges of fir trees similar to Christmas trees have been found
to afford excellent protection. In France, pine trees planted
upon the cess have effectually prevented serious snowdrifts.</p>

<p class='c000'>In sloping ground, mounds or dams, screens, plantations of
trees and hedges in very exposed places have been insufficient
to prevent some drifting and accumulation of snow in a
cutting, and a mound or fence has consequently been erected
upon the plateau at the top of the hill a sufficiently safe
distance from its face that snow-slips, which might be
increased into avalanches, were prevented from reaching the
slopes or formation. A drain should be cut upon the higher
side of such a hill-dam or fence so as to carry away the
snow-water upon a thaw, and prevent the earth becoming in
an unstable condition.</p>

<p class='c000'>No. 4.—This system is generally used when an earth
mound is also adopted and it has to be deposited from side
cutting. The trench, of course, should be on the side of the
mound farthest from the main cutting. As a snow-catcher
it is successful, especially in shallow embankments, for it not
only retains snow that would otherwise heap, but drains an
embankment.</p>

<p class='c000'>No. 5.—This depends upon the configuration of the
country, but as cuttings act as traps to catch snow, if possible
they should be avoided; and particularly when of little
depth, as it is found they quickly become choked, and want as
much protection as deeper excavations, and from being more
exposed to the cold air, the snow in them becomes caked and
frozen, and requires breaking up before it can be removed.
Embankments of a height a little above the ground, and the
greatest depth of the uniform snowfall of the country, are to
be preferred.</p>

<p class='c000'>No. 6.—Generally approved, as not only affording an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>advanced catch-trench, but because it acts as a permanent
drain.</p>

<p class='c000'>No. 7.—This is a controverted system. Some engineers
object to it as facilitating the deposition of snowdrifts; others
approve, upon the ground that by flattening the slopes the
snow can drift freely and will fall equally upon the formation.
The balance of experienced opinion seems to be rather
against the adoption of flattened slopes, unless they are made
very flat, such as from 4 to 1 <span class='fss'>TO</span> 10 to 1, at which latter slope
snow it is found does not usually accumulate but passes on
depositing only its general depth: and additional means
of protection are afforded, and appears to indicate that the
unaided system is only well adapted for countries in which
winds of great force are generated, such as the “blizzards” of
North America.</p>

<p class='c000'>No. 8.—It is found that increased width of the formation
of a cutting is an advantage, as it retards choking, facilitates
clearing operations, and provides room for shovelling snow
from the permanent way, whether effected by a snow-plough
or by manual labour.</p>

<p class='c000'>With regard to the formation width, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>, the width of the
bottom of a cutting or the top of an embankment, and the
prevention of slips in earthwork, ample breadth is necessary
in cuttings for the purposes of drainage, although less in a
rock cutting than in that of ordinary soil, and the extent of
the top of an embankment has some influence in the promotion
of stability. The required width of the formation must
be principally regulated by the character of the earth, the
amount and suddenness of the rainfall, the height of an
embankment or depth of a cutting, the degree of exposure,
the exigencies of the traffic, and the required drainage. In
wet cuttings the formation should be wider than in dry
earth, and the side ditches should be made larger, especially
when there is a steep gradient in a long cutting, in order to
keep the formation and the permanent way in as dry a state
as possible and aid traction, for the coefficient of friction of
the wheels of a locomotive will then be greater than when
the rails are damp and greasy. In cold climates the width
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>of the formation is often increased so as to lessen the depth
of snowdrifts, and to enable a snow-plough or men to more
readily deposit the excavated snow and clear the track, as has
been referred to in the immediately preceding pages; and
in severe climates in wet places ample width in cuttings is
found necessary, as drains frequently have to be cut in them
as deep as 4 to 5 feet to afford a free flow for and to prevent
an accumulation of water. In temperate climates the width
can be much reduced. When the formation is narrow the
simple percolation of water through the slopes of an embankment,
unaided by any aqueous action caused by fissures, may
gradually saturate the mass, and as the wider the formation
the larger the cross-sectional area of an embankment, it
follows that increased resisting power to deterioration is
obtained by widening the formation, as there is more earth to
absorb the water.</p>

<p class='c000'>A train upon the permanent way will make a force act
downwards until it meets with sufficient resistance to cause
reaction. The direction of the resolution of these forces is
towards a slope, therefore, the farther the surface of a slope
is from the line of action and reaction, the greater is its
distance from the disturbing force and the lateral resistance
it receives from the mass. In the case of a solid rock foundation
and a homogeneous embankment in the same state of
consolidation throughout its mass, the direction of the forces
might be accurately delineated, but as such a uniformly
homogeneous and equable condition seldom exists in railway
embankments, it cannot be absolutely said that the forces act
throughout upon certain lines; however, it is advisable to
ascertain the probable direction of the forces.</p>

<p class='c000'>The allowance for lateral settlement should be liberal and
be regulated by the nature of the earth, the height of an
embankment, and other local conditions of situation and
rainfall that affect earth, many of which are named in other
chapters. It will vary greatly, and may be anything, from
5 per cent. to 100 per cent. additional width of formation.
An addition of from 5 to 10 per cent. of the height of an
embankment is usually sufficient, but in clay sand and such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>soils an embankment may be slowly washed away by rain
until it has shrunk to half its required width. As an
embankment settles or weathers the width of the formation
should be maintained without having to steepen the slope,
widen the top, or erect a wall upon the formation in order to
hold the added earth. The additional formation width of
embankments is also a provision against the effects which the
“lurching” of an engine may cause by its weight temporarily
acting upon one rail, and the pressure to be in the 4 feet 8½ inches
gauge at a distance of about 2 feet 6 inches from the centre
of the permanent way. For some distance upon each side of
the point of junction of two high tip heads the top width
should be increased, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vide</span></i> Chap. IX., and in sidelong ground
it is advisable to widen an embankment more on the upper
side than the lower, as slips seldom occur upon the higher
side; and in the case of railways, should the lower slope
move, the rails can be placed towards the hill, and perhaps
away from the slipped portion of the embankment.</p>

<p class='c000'>With respect to the deteriorating influence of vibration as
regards the slope of a cutting or embankment, it is well
established that vibration will cause movement in a retaining
wall which would otherwise be stable, and that soils possessing
considerable powers of cohesion are not so easily affected
by vibration as those of a looser character consisting of
particles having more or less rounded surfaces; but the
action of water may produce seams in such earths as clay, and
create a smooth greasy sliding surface upon which any
reposing mass may but require the least disturbing force, on
the principle that the least impact is sufficient to impart
motion to the largest body; such as a man walking upon it
or the tread of an animal, to unbalance the delicate state of
equilibrium. This action may be gradual, continuous, and
increasing, as the earth will always be subject to changes of
weather. On the contrary, vibration in soils having
particles insoluble in water, provided water does not dissolve
any cementing material between them, may cause them to
equally settle and become firmer by being pressed together
than if they were not subject to such operation, and should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>the particles wedge by shaking and the slopes be sufficiently
flat, vibratory motion may, under these circumstances, tend to
consolidate certain earths in an embankment; but not so in
the slopes of a cutting which vibration must disturb by
reason of it agitating and loosening the surface and making
it less dense. For instance, in sandy soils the surface friction
on a cylinder, when sinking operations are not being prosecuted
and when the material is being raised from the interior,
is different; the latter resistance being from 20 to 25 per
cent. less than the former, consequent upon the disturbance,
and although fine, soft drift sand usually presents greater
frictional resistance than firm sand, it obviously cannot be
taken as equal to that of firm sand, as it is quickly
dissipated.</p>

<p class='c000'>The conditions of earth being so very diverse no rules can
be deduced, for even the effects of such stupendous force as
that of earthquake vibrations vary according to the nature
of the ground, however, the weakening effects of vibration
are undoubtedly very considerable. It is known that the
lateral thrust of earth is thereby much augmented, and,
therefore, that the strain upon the frictional resistance and
the cohesion of the earth is increased; and experiments have
shown that when a wall is nearly strained to the point of
overturning, slight vibration will quickly destroy the
equilibrium, thus demonstrating that it adds to the lateral
pressure. An analysis of some reliable experiments proves
this increase to usually range from 10 to 60 per cent., but it
is evident that the practical effect of any increase may be
very much greater than a mere computation of the increment,
for it may supply the additional strain, however small,
necessary to initiate a movement, hence the danger.</p>

<p class='c000'>As collateral testimony to the important effects of vibration
may be mentioned:—</p>

<p class='c000'>A comparison of the coefficients of friction during motion
and those at the commencement of movement or of repose.</p>

<p class='c000'>The existence of a nearly vertical face generally assumed,
when unshaken by artificial means, in the bared top earth in
a quarry, shallow well, gravel or sand pit, pond, and even a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>river-bank or a cliff, which experience has proved could not
be maintained when subject to vibration.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fact that timber piles, which are chiefly supported by
the frictional resistance of their surfaces, will not sustain a
rolling, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>, a vibratory, load equal to that of a fixed load,
and also that the method of driving in soils easily disturbed,
such as sand, is also considered as reducing the safe load
according to the percussive action and frequent vibration
caused by a pile-driver, whether worked by steam, hand, or
by means of an explosive substance. As further proof may
be named that in pile-driving, especially in open soil, piles
continually driven penetrate the earth considerably quicker
and easier than if driven at intervals, as the latter system
allows the soil to settle round them and the loosening and
friction destroying effects of vibration are lessened.</p>

<p class='c000'>The experiments made by Mr. J. A. Longridge, M. Inst.
C.E., for Mr. G. R. Stephenson, Past-President Inst. C.E., in
Morecambe Bay, England, showed that by vibration the
bearing power of driven timber piles was reduced to one-fourth
or one-fifth of that when subject to a steady non-vibratory
load.</p>

<p class='c000'>Its deleterious effect on the structure of such a solid
substance as iron, &amp;c., particularly when it is loaded beyond
its elastic limit.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is generally agreed that a substance is broken sooner
when a load is intermittingly imposed than when the same
load is permanently placed upon a structure.</p>

<p class='c000'>The experiments of Professor Stokes, 1849; M. Phillips,
1855; M. Renaudot, 1861; M. Bresse, 1866; and recently
of Dr. Winkler and others, show that the increase of the
intensity of strain consequent upon the dynamic effect of a
suddenly-applied moving load may be as much as 33 per
cent. more than that of the computed statical pressure.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fact that in masonry piers of considerable height
and small dimensions, as in piers of viaducts, the vibration
caused by trains loosens the brickwork or masonry and
necessitates frequent repairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>The theory that the particles of all solid bodies may be in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>a state of continuous vibration and motion, though there may
be no means of rendering their motion visible, has not been
refuted by deductive reasoning; but, on the other hand, it is
in accord with the theory that “motion communicates itself
among material bodies, and is never lost; when it appears to
be so, it in fact only passes from the moving body into other
bodies which are at rest, or are endued with a less velocity,
and at length it becomes insensible in consequence of its
enormous diffusion. In fact, motion can only be destroyed
by motion; resistances and friction disperse it, but do not
destroy it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The laws of statics and dynamics are well established, and
are fully described in many admirable works upon mechanical
philosophy; so far as the subject of this book is concerned
that which is required to be answered is the question. Have
the deleterious effects of vibration upon earthwork in various
conditions been determined so as to be of practical value?</p>

<p class='c000'>Not by experiment upon a large scale, nor is it probable that
they will be; but they have been deduced from experience,
reasonable inference, and experiments on a small scale, as has
been before mentioned.</p>

<p class='c000'>The effect of vibration is usually more marked in cuttings
than in embankments, although it may nearly approach
when they are of little depth or height: because a train in
a cutting is contained within the area excavated, whereas
in an embankment it is without the area deposited. In a
cutting vibration commences upon the formation level and
the toe of the slopes, the latter the most vulnerable parts
and those most strained. In an embankment it proceeds
through the formation to the base and the toes of the slopes
which are necessarily the most distant. On the other hand,
the material in an embankment is generally in a looser and
lighter condition, and therefore more inclined to move and
to suffer from vibration. It may also be greater upon one
side consequent upon the “lurching” of the engine and
carriages.</p>

<p class='c000'>Obviously, vibration is increased with the speed and weight
of a train; probably a short, heavy train travelling at high
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>speed causes a more deleterious effect than a long heavy train
travelling at a slow speed: also the higher an embankment
or the deeper a cutting the greater the area of the cross
section. Assume a train weighs 100 tons, and the weight
of the earth is 112 lbs a cubic foot, or 0·05 of a ton; it might
be considered that the effects of vibration would be less as
the areas increased. Consider the formation to be 18 feet in
width and the slopes 1½ to 1, the respective areas of cross
section would be as follows:—</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—For the purpose of a comparison of ratios it is not necessary to
consider the length of the train.</p>

<p class='c000'>A simple inspection of the above ratios would lead to a
supposition that the effects of vibration would be no less
than <span class='overunder'>3·210<br /><span class='ov'>0·165</span></span> = 19·6 times greater in a 10 feet than in a 60
feet embankment. Merely comparing the weight of a train
with that of an embankment, and assuming that the results
of vibration at the same rate of speed are so governed is
incorrect, for the effect of vibration at the formation level is
not regulated by the height of an embankment or the depth
of a cutting. The weight of a train may bear a very small
relation to that of the quantity of earth slipped, yet the soil
may have gradually become in such a state of delicate equilibrium
that at last the least vibration will destroy it, even
a little of the top soil falling upon the slope; and it
frequently occurs that a slip commences by the detachment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>of a few small lumps and increases until it becomes of
serious dimensions; therefore, the area of a cutting or
embankment cannot necessarily be considered as reducing
vibration although the source of disturbance may be more
distant; but, of course, the heavier the mass the greater the
weight and speed required to cause the whole to vibrate.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lighthouses and such exposed works being constantly
subject to vibration, the experience gained through their
behaviour may be considered as indicating the direction in
which the stability of structures in analogous situations has
to be sought. It is generally agreed that it favours weight
and bulk, as they are unchangeable, and shows that although
the form, execution, and the material may be perfect, a light
fabric will gradually be deteriorated by constant tremor and
vibratory motion, at length culminating in the loosening and
separation of the parts.</p>

<p class='c000'>Except from actual experiment in each case, it is impossible
to determine the greatest weight of and the speed at which
a train should be allowed to travel so as to prevent any
deleterious effect from vibration, and the circumstances are
so various that a practical rule cannot be deduced, except by
assuming conditions from experience alone, which would so
modify a formula as to make it show any desired result, and
cause it to be regarded as too complaisant to be trusted.
Perhaps the best test of the effects of vibration that any
earthworks can receive is when a temporary railway is laid
upon the formation or cess for the carriage of materials, and
in a lesser degree a steam excavator, as the weight and
vibratory action may show the weak places in a cutting, or
so shake portions of an embankment that should the earth be
unstable a slip will soon occur.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Earthworks in or upon Sidelong Ground.—Some Insecure Conditions.—Precautionary
Measures.—Embankments upon Soft
Ground.—Embankments Composed of Soft Earth.—The Promotion
of Stability and Consolidation.</span></p>

<p class='c005'>With regard to earthworks in or upon sidelong ground, the
configuration of the surface conduces to a movement of the
hill-slope of a cutting, and the centre of gravity of an
embankment is not in the middle, and in a narrow embankment
may be outside the central portion, the tendency,
therefore, is for the slope of an embankment on the upper or
hill-side to assume a steeper inclination than that on the
lower, as the earth is tipped against the inclined ground
until the point is reached where a perpendicular erected
upon the surface of the ground cuts the top of the inside
slope. This slope, if protected from weathering, might be
allowed to stand at the inclination at which it remains when
tipped, and be simply trimmed and covered; but the toe of
the slope on the lower or valley side is especially likely to
slip, and therefore, every precaution should be taken to
prevent movement. A retaining wall is a certain protection,
benching the ground, weighting the foot of the slope,
dividing it into benches about 10 to 15 feet apart, varying
in width from 5 feet and increasing according to the depth;
the benches having sufficient inclination to prevent an
accumulation of water; counterforting the slopes in dry
and mild weather with simple earth counterforts 5 to 12 feet
in width at intervals, and in length about twice their height
with a reasonable slope, the height being about half that of
the embankment; a dry retaining wall may also be erected
in temperate climates and in a comparatively unexposed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>situation: are all precautionary measures that can be
adopted. But in the case of a cutting in drift or permeable
soil upon rock or an impermeable surface liable to become
wet, which not infrequently occurs, the conditions of equilibrium
may easily be destroyed, and the slope upon the
higher side may not stand at a less inclination than that of
the hill. Obviously this slope cannot be obtained either in
cuttings or embankments, therefore, provided the drift is of
considerable depth and treacherous, means must be taken to
prevent movement, and drains should be inserted so as to
make the earth capable of standing at a steeper inclination
than it naturally assumes; and in order to drain the ground
at the seat of an embankment, a trench on the valley side
filled with stones or supported by other means acting as a
wall and drain can be made. Every precaution should be
taken to prevent any accumulation of water in earthworks
in sidelong ground, and to gently control them, and to
promote this object it is well that lateral outlets be opposite
to each other so as to afford through drainage and an
unobstructed flow.</p>

<p class='c000'>As drift soil upon the inclined surface of a rock may be
held by friction, the least change may impair it sufficiently
to cause movement, therefore it is advisable to have a narrow
gullet or heading excavated in short lengths, followed <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pari
passu</span></i> with protective works, whether a retaining wall or not,
so that the earth is weakened as little as possible by exposure
and deprivation of its usual support; and there are many
places in which, unless the system of excavating in short
lengths be adopted, failure and slips must result.</p>

<p class='c000'>In sidelong ground the formation is frequently partly in
cutting and partly in embankment, if so, and the drain is
impermeable and can be thoroughly relied upon, it may be
advisable to make the formation incline towards the hill, so
as to drain it, lessen, and perhaps prevent percolation into
the semi-embankment or under its seat, for the soil being
loosened by the process of excavation and deposition is in the
mass more porous than in a cutting.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chief aim of all drainage operations for the preservation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>of earthworks in sidelong ground is to prevent the
hill waters guidelessly flowing into, upon, or under them,
their accumulation, or any obstruction to their easy discharge;
and to attain this object it is necessary to know the
location of the sources of the supply, the quantity, and other
particulars, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vide</span></i> Chap. IV. A proper system of drains must
therefore be made upon the hill-side to gather and gently
guide the waters, to lead them by channels across the
formation and discharge them outside it, care being taken
to protect and line the surface of the drains so that no
leakage occurs or any erosion of the face. In countries
where the rainfall is excessive or sudden at certain places or
entirely, it may be sufficient to protect the slopes so as to
allow of a flow over them, and particularly upon the valley
slope of an embankment, and in a lesser degree upon the
hill-slope of a cutting.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the configuration of the country allows, it is advisable
to avoid cuttings, and particularly embankments, in or
upon drift soil lying upon an inclined surface of rock or
impermeable soil, because it can so easily be disturbed,
become unstable, and of the difficulty of restoring it to a state
of equilibrium; in fact, this may be impossible, as vibration
may cause it to move. In such a case the only means of
preventing a slip is by erecting a wall at the toe of the slope,
and as it is necessary that the foundations be in the rock
beneath the surface earth, the simple operation of excavating
may impel the drift down the hill. Also should an embankment
be required upon drift soil its weight may be sufficient
to cause the mass to slide and a diversion of a railway may
be imperative, for the cost of a retaining wall, because of its
height and the great pressure it would have to sustain, or be
built to sustain, would prohibit the adoption of such a
remedy. Therefore, an embankment is more to be feared
than a cutting in such earth. Making benchings in the rock
below the drift to resist movement of an embankment will
most probably be impracticable, and the soil may be in such
a delicate condition that a shock or very little additional
weight may make it slip, and when once it has moved, its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>stability may not be permanently restored. Such a case may
be considered as one of the worst that can be encountered, and
certainly the simple removal of detached masses of rock that
may slide upon the formation is easier to effect than to treat
drift soil upon an inclined rock bed.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is always well to remember that in sidelong ground a hill
may be reposing at the steepest slope of stability, and when
the earth is rock it may dip in the direction of a cutting or
be imposed upon a perishable stratum, such as porous or
inferior shale. Support upon the valley side is then
absolutely necessary to restore its normal equilibrium, and
every care should be taken to prevent water reaching the
embankment or trickling under its base, and to control all
water that may permeate through fissures in the rock face,
especially should it be loosely bedded. Earthworks in such
positions require to be regularly watched.</p>

<p class='c000'>In forming an embankment upon sidelong ground every
means should be adopted to increase the friction between the
tipped material and the soil; consequently all turf or herbage
should be removed in order that the embankment may be
upon the bare earth, care being taken that no loose top
mould or turf is deposited, but only the firm soil. It may be
advisable to only tip earth excavated from the solid hill-side,
and not top soil such as that obtained from side cutting, and
unless in rock or firm soil to avoid partly side cutting and
embankment.</p>

<p class='c000'>Should an embankment have to be tipped upon rock, care
must be taken to prevent the surface water flowing under its
base, and to counteract sliding movement the ground should
be benched and a drain made on the higher side; also in a
deep cutting the slope or face should be stepped, or have a
cess at about mid-height, or where desirable, to lessen the
effect of the trickling of the surface water and to prevent a
flow in a direct line, which might make the velocity of any
leakage waters dangerous, especially after a rapid thaw.
On a mid-cess a catchwater drain should be cut to intercept
the surface water, which may not percolate but flow upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>the slope, and, unless diverted and conducted to an outlet,
may saturate or erode the bottom.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before a cutting in drift soil upon the side of a hill can
be drained, it may be necessary to sink a shaft upon the
higher side some distance from the slope and construct a
complete series of drains under the formation. Also should
an embankment in sidelong ground be near to a river, the
exposed river-bank face must be protected, and in any
case, when a pier of a bridge has to be placed close to the
edge of a rock, the face of the earth should be preserved
by a substantial Portland cement concrete covering in
order to prevent disintegration culminating in a slip or
subsidence.</p>

<p class='c000'>In setting out a line of railway or a canal care should be
taken to avoid, if practicable, either cuttings or embankments
in soil resting upon inclined rock, as slips are almost
sure to occur. However, should it be unavoidable, their
depth and height should be reduced to a minimum and,
if possible, the formation be raised until the bare rock crops
out, and this can frequently be effected within the limits of
deviation. Also deep cuttings in clay or earth, having
particles soon affected by weather, should be avoided, but
they may be necessary; and should any have to be located
upon a sharp curve, it is advisable to excavate the projecting
spur on the convex side of the curve more than that required
to obtain the formation width, as it is peculiarly exposed, and
therefore more likely to slip. When cuttings are upon the
escarpment of a clay hill the slope upon the valley side need
not be so flat as that against the hill. An inclination of 3 or
4 to 1 may be necessary upon the hill-side, whereas a 1½ to
1 slope may be sufficient upon the other. When a slip may
involve the destruction or injury of any adjacent buildings,
the best plan is to erect a retaining wall at the foot of a slope,
not less than about one-fourth of the height of an embankment
or the depth of a cutting, ample provision being made
for drainage and the expansion of the earth. It is a sure
protection and support, and the consequences of a slip may
be most serious in such a position. The protection of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>slope and a breast wall may, however, be alone necessary
upon the valley-side.</p>

<p class='c000'>The construction of embankments upon soft soil is here
referred to so far as regards lateral movement, or where
vertical settlement causes such action by drawing asunder.
Whenever the surface of the ground bulges or upheaves upon
earth being tipped upon it or pressure applied, it shows
that the disturbing harbingers of instability are in action
and that its sustaining power has been reached, its surface
ruptured, and any more soil placed thereon will only sink
and displace the earth until it meets the solid ground
beneath, or the material becomes sufficiently compressed and
dense for it to sustain the load; such a condition of unrest
generally proceeds from over-pressure and will loosen the
soil, increase percolation, and aid disintegration. When it
is known that soft, peaty, muddy, or silty earth overlies level
solid ground, and it is certain it cannot escape, and can only
be condensed by weighting until it will permanently bear
the strain required, it can be built upon; although should
there be more pressure at one place than another, or the
character of the soil vary, in certain places be swampy and
in others dry, the surrounding ground will probably rise
where the weight is the least; therefore, increased bearing
area of an embankment maybe necessary until the sustaining
power of the earth is not exceeded, or slips and subsidences
will occur, for the weight of an embankment in such a
situation cannot be diminished by retaining walls, as stable
foundations are not to be obtained. It is obvious the width
of the formation cannot be reduced and therefore the only
way of lessening the load upon the base per square foot,
assuming the embankment to act as a mass, and of distributing
its weight, is by flattening the slope and making
a platform under the seat of an embankment. All earths,
however, that are not hard rock subside upon being weighted,
and in the case of tenacious clay soils, upon a considerable
load being applied over a small area, a trifling contiguous
uplifting of the ground will generally be noticed. If such
rise of the soil does not exceed about one-sixth of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>settlement of the clay under the load it may be disregarded
as not likely to cause a slip or serious lateral movement.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the foundation consists of a firm stratum of gravel,
sand, or solid earth overlying soft soil such as quicksand or
silt, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>, mud and sand; or alluvial deposit, care must be
taken that the latter is not forced up at a weak place by the
additional weight of an embankment, and the firm stratum
undermined, as then it will sink, fissure, and be unsafe.
Any disturbance of the bed or water of an estuary or lake
other than by the tides, currents, or wind is an indication
that the earth beneath the firm soil is overloaded, and that
subsidences and slips will ensue.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before determining upon the necessary precautions that
must be taken, the deposits should be thoroughly examined
and tests made of the amount of soluble and insoluble
material in a certain mass, as although the earth may have
the appearance of being mud, it may contain a preponderating
proportion of insoluble particles of sand, and its character
may hardly be that of mud or silt. When a marsh rests
upon clay it usually requires only reasonable care, but if
upon mud or loose sand it may always be in a more or less
unstable condition.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chief means of consolidation in the construction of
embankments of soft soil upon soft ground may be stated to
be as follows:—</p>

<p class='c000'>1. Draining, which must be deep, and should be effected
before the earth embankment is deposited.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. Weighting the ground outside the slopes with firm
material so as to consolidate the soil by intermixture with
it.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. The formation of terraces of earth, and by allowing the
ground to subside until movement is arrested, but there may
be a porous seam of harder soil, such as gravel, under the
soft ground, then care must be taken not to dam back the
flow of the underground waters by the subsidence of the
added earth or the whole embankment may slide, become
softened and finally be swept away; therefore, through
drainage must be maintained under an embankment.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>4. Making the load as light as possible consistent with
due consolidation.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. Constructing an embankment in equal and regular
layers of ashes or other dry, light, stable soil, and by drying
the earth to be deposited by separation, wind, sun, or by
burning.</p>

<p class='c000'>To prevent slips in such situations, draining, although
causing subsidence, should be executed as long as possible
before the embankment is tipped, is more effectual and
certain in its action than any system of lessening the load or
of counterweighting the soil, which may thereby temporarily
be brought to rest but afterwards give way; and any
damming back of water may cause additional sinking, and
change the condition of the earth from a state of dampness
to that of saturation. It may be easy to calculate the
weight per square foot that will have to be sustained by the
ground from an embankment and the heaviest train, but to
make the necessary allowance for the effects of vibration is
not so readily computed. The ground can be weighted to
ascertain the limit of its sustaining power. The test should
extend for a period of several weeks to be thoroughly
reliable, which time can seldom be afforded upon works;
therefore a considerable excess of sustaining power over the
load should be allowed.</p>

<p class='c000'>In draining the site of an embankment in peat soil, it is
advisable first to ascertain the depth to which trenches can
be cut without the sides falling in. It generally varies from
about 1 foot 6 inches to 3 feet. As the ground becomes
firmer the drains can be deepened if required. The width
should not be less than 2 feet 6 inches to 3 feet. Cross drains
can be cut at every 20 to 40 feet according to the state of the
soil. Peat usually drains freely at the surface when its level
is not at or below the water-bearing line of the country. A
successful method of thoroughly draining the surface of peat
moorland is to first make a drain about 1 foot 6 inches in width
and the depth of an ordinary spade, and leave it for a time
until the top soil to that depth becomes firmer, then repeat the
operation until a depth of 3 feet is obtained, the sides being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>excavated to a perpendicular face, the top turf being carefully
cut and stacked upon the surface to dry. Along the centre
of the bottom of the trench a small cut is made about 1 foot in
depth and 6 inches in width, leaving a 6-inch ledge upon each
side, then the dry stacked turf 1 foot 6 inches in width
previously excavated, is placed upon the ledge, the grass
downwards and the layers reversed in rotation to the order in
which they were excavated. This system in moss peat land is
cheaper and better than tile or rough stone drains, as they
often settle unequally. The underneath drain will not close
up provided the excavated turf is carefully deposited, and
water will not disintegrate the peat. These drains should
be cut about 20 feet apart.</p>

<p class='c000'>A more extensive system may be necessary, and a comparatively
large area may be required to be drained in order to
obtain a firm foundation and to prevent breaking away of the
ground. In such event the first drain on each side parallel
to an embankment should be at a distance from the centre
line of the formation at least equal to the bottom width of
an embankment, and as deep as the soil will allow, so as to
drain the land within the fences. A cut should also be made
outside the fencing at a distance of not less than 10 feet from
the inside drain, to catch the surface waters and prevent
their flowing upon the enclosed land. Cross drains may be
required at intervals of from 15 to 50 feet according to the
character and depth of the bog. The sides of the open
drains may require to be supported. Branches of trees and
rough fascine work laid in them have been used to an extent
so as not to interfere with the flow; and when a spoil or
fence bank has to be deposited it should be made a reasonable
distance from the drains or they may become closed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every effort should be directed to make the drainage of the
same degree throughout the area; it is therefore necessary to
know whether the water can be discharged into a channel or
adjacent river, or if the bottom of the drains will be above
the general water-discharge level of the district so as to
prevent the ground being in the condition of a sponge
always full of water and becoming a floating mass. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>the peat soil is of little depth and rests upon sand or clay,
drainage can be effected by side drains reaching to the
underlying stratum, and the drains can be open and be filled
with gravel to prevent the sides falling or the bottom rising.
Few serious slips will take place in bog-land when the
precautionary works named in this chapter are more or less
executed; subsidence is then the chief difficulty. It cannot
be entirely prevented, but it may be lessened. It is frequently
very considerable, depending principally upon the
depth, situation, and character of the deposit and the
proportion of water in it. Deep bog-lands upon being
drained have subsided as much as 4 to 5 feet the first year,
and 10 to 12 feet the second, and in the worst situations
they will continue to subside until the earth is sufficiently
compact to support the insistent weight, and they have sunk
as much as 30 feet before the ground became consolidated.
Burnt ballast, fine gravel, or sandy gravel, is to be preferred
as ballast upon peat embankments, as affording an even
coating and tending to consolidate the earth, whereas broken
rock ballast breaks up the surface, as the pieces are not
uniform in size and are fragmentary. The cost of maintenance
on bog or marsh-land is sure to be heavy for two or
three years, but then the road will generally have become
firm. The chief points in maintenance are to cause equal
loading and to promote thorough drainage. Baulks laid
under the sleepers, or the longitudinal system of permanent
way, is not advantageous in soft soil, and even should a
longitudinal bearer be placed upon the cross sleepers the
road is difficult to lift or pack, and less timber will be
required by a reduction of the distance between the cross
sleepers. The rail joints should also be stiffened so as to
make the depth of the undulations consequent upon the
passage of a train as regular as possible, and the number of
the sleepers can be increased with this object.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sustaining power of peat moss, and peat which is
sometimes found under a bed of gravel and upon a substratum
of clay or marl; and bog-land varies greatly. As a rule
high bog-land will bear the greater weight. The only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>reliable method of ascertaining its sustaining capabilities
is by an actual test, and such experiments are the more
requisite in unreliable soils such as mud and slake, alluvial
deposits, peat and bog-land. It is known that some mossy
peat and bog-land will not even resist the weight of a stone
of ordinary size, but will upheave and shake upon very little
pressure being applied. By draining and other consolidating
operations such land may be rendered capable of sustaining
a load if the weight be spread over a considerable area upon
a platform of poles, timber, or fascine work, as it then as it
were, floats upon the surface; but piling is not successful, as
the piles disunite the particles, destroy the continuity of the
layers and make a passage for water. The elasticity of bog-land
is manifest even when a road-bed has become sufficiently
firm and even-bearing for traffic, by the agitation of the
water in any adjoining drains.</p>

<p class='c000'>In low bog-land, peat-moss, or peat-land, it is important
to ascertain whether the deposit extends to a considerable
depth, as in Holland it has been found that some marshes
simply rest upon a bed of water, being nothing but floating
peat moss, although having as great a thickness as 20 feet.
It has also been noticed that marsh-lands often rest upon
peat mosses with a small layer or film of loam upon them,
and that they are floating masses, although the water upon
which they float may not be deep; its depth may be known
by the insertion of a bar or boring-tool, for when it sinks
suddenly it has probably reached the water, and until its
downward movement stops it shows that water exists.</p>

<p class='c000'>Peat bogs consist of decomposed mosses, grasses, aquatic
plants, and mud. In mountainous districts when they are
superimposed upon hard or non-weathering rock, such as
quartz, they have little thickness; if upon clay rock, or any
that decomposes under weather influences, they are usually
of considerable depth. As a rule, the greater the specific
gravity of peat, the firmer it is and also the darker. The
top layers are generally the most fibrous and the driest,
although spongy and containing vegetable matter, and are
of a light brown colour, and of less specific gravity than the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>next deposit, which is of a darker brown tint, and is denser
and more decomposed; the peat then becomes brown black
or black in hue and approaches a coaly condition. Compact
turf usually contains little water, but should it be of a
mossy nature it is generally saturated. Wet bog, peat, or
moorland may contain as much as 80 per cent. of water, and
any soil having so large a proportion must necessarily
subside and change upon being thoroughly and regularly
drained, and have its bearing power increased in a ratio
approximate to the percentage of water in it before
draining and that after such operation has been effected,
other conditions being similar. The depth and character of
the top layers will indicate the best method of procedure,
and whether it is advisable to excavate them and deposit an
embankment upon the lower and firmer bed.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Holland, where the peat is superimposed upon sandy
soil, in order to prevent slips in embankments it is found
advisable to excavate a trench about 15 to 20 feet in width
and as wide as the formation width of a railway or road,
until it reaches the subsoil, and to fill it with sand; and
when an embankment has to be formed of very porous
earth, to make a trench at the toe of each slope, and to fill it
with sand so as to act as a counterfort. Peat and sand
have been found to laterally spread the most, clay and sand
less, and therefore the latter soil stands at a steeper slope.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the South Austrian system of railways marsh-land has
been made firm, and malaria-fever almost annihilated by
depositing ashes over the earth. When they are mixed with
the bog or swamp deposit, it is found that they cause it to
become fertile.</p>

<p class='c000'>Peaty soils and peat bogs, which latter it should always be
remembered may be almost floating upon water and have a
surface layer of vegetation and moss, must be differently
treated to other soft soils, and thorough drainage may be
economically impossible in deep deposits. In such a situation,
as the peat is alone capable of bearing the pressure, it should
not be disturbed or the particles disunited, for the continuity
of the layers will then be destroyed, and probably cause an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>upward flow or other passage of water upon pressure being
applied. This state is frequently met with where inland waters
have existed, as in that case the peat moss covering has sunk, the
depression depending upon the depth of the peat underneath
it and the distance at which the firm ground is reached. It
is, therefore, advisable to ascertain this, as then some idea of
the probable subsidence may be known.</p>

<p class='c000'>The system of a platform of poles, hurdles, or fascine-work
is well known, and has been proved to be effectual in preventing
any dangerous lateral or vertical movement. Sand,
fine gravel, ashes, or other binding material, spread over the
surface of peat consolidates it and assists in preventing
movement, and it is well if such a covering extends for some
distance in front and at the sides of an embankment to keep
the ground from rising. Upon soft soil, a thick layer of
clean sand, well wetted and consolidated, 5 feet or more in
depth, has been used in lieu of piles for forming a bed upon
which to deposit a Portland cement concrete foundation to
receive heavy masonry piers of a bridge, and at much less
expense and with greater expedition, and no slip or subsidence
of the ground has occurred.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is obvious the earth should be deposited in even layers,
similarly to the general method of closing reclamation
embankments from the bottom upwards; staging is, therefore,
necessary for the waggons to run upon and discharge
their contents, but piles should not be driven, as they disturb
and upheave the earth and do not consolidate any soil. A
successful system of depositing embankments of bog or peat
earth is to thoroughly cut up, pun, and tread down the soil
in order that it may not shrink in cakes. If an embankment
subsides and must be raised, only light earth or
material should be used. “Forming” or embankments of
little height are usually made from the drain excavation,
and when more earth is required the outer ditches are
widened and deepened so that the fenced-in land is made
as firm as possible upon which a railway or a road has to be
maintained.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fascine mattresses, to prevent slips and subsidence in an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>embankment in very soft ground, such as loose sand, are to
be recommended, and experienced engineers have expressed
their belief that they are the best means of procuring a
firm foundation and securing it from scour in loose sandy
and soft deposits; and their employment may become
necessary when the earth is very wet, and the contour of the
district renders effective drainage or consolidation of the
soil difficult or impracticable. Should the ground after
drainage be only damp, brushwood, or heather, so laid as to
offer the firmest and most even bed may be sufficient; and if
sand can be used with it, it is very advantageous; but the
fascine or a more solid method of distributing weight may
have to be adopted. Fascines should be laid over the whole
base of an embankment and extend some little distance upon
each side, beyond the toe of the slope, and be made stronger
according to the load they have to support, which, of course,
increases towards the centre of an embankment, where it is
greatest, in order to prevent their breaking apart and
becoming detached.</p>

<p class='c000'>In peaty soils an embankment should be formed of light
dry materials, be spread out, have equal bearing, and be of
as little height as possible, and all hollows and depressions
should be carefully filled. The worst state of peaty or bog
soils upon which an embankment has to be tipped is when
they are no better than a floating mass.</p>

<p class='c000'>Where a stratum of sound firm soil, such as gravel, lies
upon a soft bed of great depth, by increasing the bearing
area upon the firm earth and not interfering with it, a
stable foundation for an embankment may be obtained. In
such a case a cutting should be avoided, for if care be taken
not to impair or injure the firm top layer it may stand
without serious subsidence, but under other conditions it
would be unstable, and when a soft stratum is affected and
its natural condition altered, it may be very difficult to
restore it to a state of permanent equilibrium in consequence
of it being in almost a constant state of mutation.</p>

Procedure.—Consideration of Some of the Different Systems.—The
Effect of the Height of a Tip and the Length of a
Lead.—The Steam Navvy and Embankments.</span></p>

<p class='c005'>With regard to the deposition of an embankment, one of
the chief objects to be accomplished is to make it homogeneous
and prevent the formation of solid layers, which may become
detached along the line of stratification from less compact
strata. Careless and intermittent tipping conducted in dry
and wet weather and with different kinds of earth, probably
in various conditions, will cause slips and subsidences; as
also any local disturbance of the soil, which is always more
porous and absorbent of water than when in its natural
unexcavated state, although it may be free from water-pressure
which may exist in a cutting: and particularly so
when fresh-tipped, as then the pressure and strain upon it is
at the maximum, its tendency to unstableness gradually
decreasing as it becomes consolidated. In hard granular soils
this is almost certainly the case, but consequent upon
percolation of water into a mass deposited in a dry state
that expands; it may not be so in aluminous or other earth
having particles affected by moisture, for an additional or an
unequal load after a settlement may cause further movement
and irregular density. In countries where the ground
becomes caked or parched during the dry season, the change
to a wet or saturated condition affects them much more than
in variable climates, as they are then generally in a moist
state.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is easy to decree that no embankment shall be made of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>any earth of a treacherous character, if the circumstances
are known to conduce to instability, and to rigidly specify
what shall be done and what shall not be done, but the
exigencies of an undertaking may cause such stipulations
to be impracticable. For instance, it may be found that no
other earth may be available except that which is proscribed.
No one with a knowledge of earthwork would
desire to erect an embankment of considerable height of
yellow or sandy clay, or excavate a deep cutting in such
soil unless a considerable allowance be made to provide
against contingencies; nevertheless, it has to be done, and
will have to be done. The precisianism and delicate
refinement of a specification replete with good intentions
has, therefore, very frequently to be toned down in order
to allow of the execution of work.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is obvious the care that is bestowed upon a reservoir
embankment, such as the damping, punning, rolling, mixing
of the material, and raising it in layers, is not necessary
in a railway or ordinary embankment; however, certain
precautions should be observed and may be effected at a
small cost, and it is well to remember that errors of
construction will cause undue strain upon particular parts.
A fruitful cause of a slip or subsidence in an embankment
is the variation of the character and condition of the tipped
earth. It seldom happens that the soil of a cutting of
considerable extent is the same throughout in character and
condition; and the earth in an embankment tipped at one
end may be different to that deposited at the other, and
therefore the point of contact of the two earths will
probably be troublesome. When a seam of unstable soil
occurs in a clay cutting, it should not be tipped but be run
to spoil. Such layers are usually of small extent, yet in an
embankment they may cause portions to run in rainy or
frosty weather.</p>

<p class='c000'>Side cuttings are a protection against slips in embankments
when they are sufficiently far from the toe of the
slope, as they form drainage channels, but the excavation
being top soil is loose and porous, therefore, when the lower
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>portion of an embankment is made from side cutting and
the upper from a cutting, the firm material may be at the
top and the more open earth at the base; consequently, if
an embankment in soil of a doubtful character must be
partly constructed from side cutting and partly from
cutting, especial care is required in forming it so as to
prevent slips and subsidence, and also, in excavating any
ground for such purposes, it is advisable not to interfere
with any ditches, or join them, as by concentration a stream
may be created. In countries where land is of little value,
contractor’s plant expensive, not to be obtained in the
district, and carriage costly, embankments in most cases can
be more cheaply and quickly deposited from side cutting
than cutting, the excavation from the latter being run to
spoil instead of tipped by waggons into the embankment,
therefore, their erection by such means becomes imperative
for reasons of economy.</p>

<p class='c000'>In depositing embankments it is well to remember that
experience has proved that materials uniform in size and
homogeneous in character form the most compact and
impenetrable masses. The great stability of breakwaters
formed of materials of uniform size and the firmness of
macadamized roads are proofs of this. The same rule
applies to soils. It is the separation of the larger bodies
from the smaller that causes a want of cohesiveness and
weight-sustaining power.</p>

<p class='c000'>To prevent embankments of little height as in “forming,”
spreading, slipping or weathering, as they are usually
constructed from side cutting and loose top soil, the sods over
the site of the side cutting should be removed and a turf
wall be made of them on each side of the formation, the
excavation being deposited within them, when it will settle
equally and become consolidated, the wall preventing it
spreading and also saving expense in maintenance.</p>

<p class='c000'>In an embankment of soft earth that weathers quickly,
the tipped material should be allowed to take its natural
slope, and then every effort should be made to prevent its
equilibrium being destroyed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>Where heavy and sudden rainfall occurs the edges of the
formation have been purposely tipped and maintained from
6 to 12 inches above the height of the centre, in order to
prevent during construction gutters or eroded channels being
formed upon the slopes, the central portion being drained
and the water led away. However, aqueous action may not
deleteriously affect earth when tipped into an embankment
notwithstanding that the soil cannot be made in the same
state as before excavation, and that deposited material is
more open and subject to percolation than the solid unexcavated
earth; on the other hand, although the percolation
and degree of exposure to the atmosphere are greater, in
some soils this may tend to drain and render them harder
and more stable. In fact, special circumstances may alter
the general behaviour of any earth, but the material forming
an embankment should be regarded as in the same condition
as if it had been exposed to meteorological influences, and it
should be remembered that in railway, dock, or canal works
the deposited earth is seldom uniform throughout, it being
either soft at one place and hard at another, or intermixed in
a manner unknown in nature, and that exceptionally difficult
cases may occur which can hardly be treated by any
particular method of procedure or even in the way which
experience has proved to be effectual in several instances
in similar soils under apparently like conditions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The system of tipping has some influence upon the stability
of an embankment and the prevention of slips and subsidences.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first operation is the preparation of the ground upon
which an embankment will be deposited. Solid hillocks or
firm mounds that in any way tend to arrest motion should
not be removed, but vegetable or bush growth should be destroyed,
and where slips and subsidences are likely to occur,
turf and all soft soapy matter should be stripped so that the
deposited earth rests upon a sound stratum. In the dyke
countries of North West Europe, before an embankment is
deposited, care is taken to remove all trees and roots so as to
effect a thorough connection between the ground and the
earth forming the embankment.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>It is well if the ground be ploughed, raked, or harrowed,
so as to offer a rough and similar surface to the tipped
material, and also to obviate any arrest of the percolation of
water, which upon reaching a turf or smooth or less
permeable surface, may form a water seam at the foot
of an embankment. It may not be necessary to strip
the turf for the full width of the base of an embankment,
but only for some 20 feet from the toe of the slope on
each side. As the earth is bared it should be covered in
order not to expose it to the weather, for should the surface
be coated with mud, water will accumulate, as it cannot
drain away or evaporate as quickly as when the ground at
the seat is laid bare; and also if the top soil be mere dust
moisture will convert it into mud. When the surface of the
ground is inclined it can be benched or bared, and it is open
to question whether baring and harrowing the surface is
not a better practice than benching, as it gives uniform
support and increases friction and prevents a sliding surface,
and is generally a quicker and cheaper method to adopt as
the soil need not be so prepared for a greater depth than 6 to
9 inches. Benching may be the better system to adopt, in
loose and non-cohesive earths which require support to
prevent rolling, but it must be carefully made with the necessary
slopes and inclination of cess to prevent a localization
of water, or the ledges may slip and carry away the material
deposited upon them. The ground at the seat of an embankment
can also be prepared by ploughing over it and removing
the disturbed earth with a scraper.</p>

<p class='c000'>The drainage of the ground is most important in order
that water cannot reach the seat of an embankment. Many
systems are referred to in Chapter IV., and others are herein
named. A complete system of drains may be necessary, but
much depends upon the character and sound condition of the
earth and whether the slopes and formation are protected.
Simply covering the whole area of the seat, or that upon
which the base of the slopes rests, with broken stone
obtained from the cuttings may suffice, the stone being so
deposited that water flows from the centre to the sides,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>with a rough drain here and there, or central, diagonal, and
lateral drains may be required; but the pressure of the
deposited earth frequently causes land springs to issue in the
seat of an embankment, the existence of which was not
conjectured, hence the effect of tipping should be watched.</p>

<p class='c000'>Slips and subsidences are induced in embankments by the
material being deposited when the soil is dry, and in every
state of humidity from dampness to saturation; consequently
the earth settles unequally, is denser in parts, and a stratification
is caused as if it were composed of dissimilar earths.
Should any soil be deposited in the same condition throughout,
and be punned or rammed in layers, it becomes as near
its original texture as is possible to quickly attain; but in
depositing railway embankments, which cannot be punned or
rammed, the perfect incorporation of any soil is not effected
by the simple operation of tipping from a spurn head, and
stratification of earth is disadvantageous, inasmuch as the
layers may not be homogeneous, and in railway embankments
are, with a few exceptions, in a different state owing
to changes in the character of the soil, the effects of weather,
mode of excavation, and in a lesser degree the height and
length of the lead or distance from the cutting to the tip;
the stratification, therefore, becomes varied and irregular,
and depressions are formed which may hold water, and none
should be permitted to accumulate in or upon a freshly
tipped embankment, for then it is in its most permeable
condition, and in retentive soil especially the existence of a
wet place may cause it to become so deteriorated that it
cannot be made stable without being drained, and when
the earth is liable to become alternately very wet and dry,
every means must be taken to lessen the deleterious effects.</p>

<p class='c000'>Provided an embankment is tipped of one kind of earth,
although it will be in a more open state than the solid
unexcavated ground, the slopes given to it are flatter than
the angle of repose, the weight brought upon it does not
exceed the safe load, that it is deposited upon level ground
in regular and equal particles and the soil of ordinary
character, there is no reason that it should slip or subside
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>unequally if it be not undermined by aqueous action. Under
these conditions settlement would be equal, or nearly so, and
as all deep embankments must necessarily subside from
about 10 to 40 per centum, and in extreme cases one-half,
the object to be gained is to cause the settlement to be even
and regular towards the centre. Benching the ground so as
to prevent a movement of the toe, does not aid equal settlement
nor keep the portion of an embankment above the level
of the ground from spreading, except from the resistance
offered by the cohesion and friction of the soil; whereas, if
the ground slopes inwards towards the centre the earth
has a tendency to rest and come together, and therefore
not to slip upon the slopes. This system is subsequently
referred to.</p>

<p class='c000'>All saturated or wet earth should, if practicable, be run to
spoil, but it is not easily effected, as it cannot well be filled
into one waggon of a set, for it may be present throughout
the whole surface of a cutting, nor in variable weather can
operations be conveniently suspended until the exposed faces
of a cutting are dry, but means are generally available by
which any serious deterioration may be lessened.</p>

<p class='c000'>No turf, mould, mud, peat-moss, soft pasty earth, frozen
soil, or snow, should be deposited in an embankment, but
only firm earth; and no solid lumps of large size intermixed
with shovelled material unless they are broken up and
trimmed when tipped, as the absorption of water will be
greater in the earth having the smaller particles; and should
it happen that several waggon-loads of such material are
tipped and are succeeded by others containing large lumps,
an embankment cannot be a homogeneous mass, but will
consist of more or less consolidated portions in a comparatively
dry state, and others which are less impervious and
therefore more subject to the effects of water and settlement.
All snow or frozen soil or muddy earth should be cleared
away from the spurn head, and if it can be avoided no
material should be tipped in bad weather.</p>

<p class='c000'>With respect to the loosening of the soil by the process of
tipping, taking into consideration that railway embankments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>are almost invariably formed in masses of 2, 3, or 4 cubic
yards, according to the capacity of a waggon, it is obvious
almost the whole bulk has been disturbed, and that the
condition of the solid earth in a cutting is not maintained,
for the soil in addition to being unbound by the process of
excavation, casting into waggons, and shaking during
transition, is ejected with force down the slope of the tip,
the impetus having to be dispersed. It is certain the size
of earth waggons cannot conveniently be much increased, and
that little would be gained if a cubic yard or two were
added to their contents; and that the higher an embankment
the greater the velocity of the soil down the slope of the tip
and the loosening action which causes the earth to be lighter
and to take a flatter slope than when deposited in layers
from a moderate height, also the greater the length of the
lead, the greater the vibration and agitation. In the case of
certain soils the particles of which become soft or dissolved
when in a wet state, such as sandy clay, loamy soil, and
some varieties of clay, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vide</span></i> Chapter II., the effect of a long
lead or even a short one will be that the more solid portion
of the contents of a waggon will settle, leaving the loose or
mud at the top, and when a waggon is tipped the loose top
“slurry” will roll down the tip almost as a fluid and proceed
beyond the spurn head, thus making a wet sliding
surface, the bottom toil frequently remaining in the waggons
and requiring to be excavated from it. Nothing can be done
in such a case but wait until the earth has had time to dry,
or preferably the wet mud should be run to spoil. In fact a
long lead, especially when aided by deposition from a considerable
height, will cause friable soil possessing particles
readily impaired or dissolved in water to become dust when
in a dry state, or mud if saturated.</p>

<p class='c000'>The gradients and leads chiefly determine the manner
in which earthwork can be economically executed, and are,
in great measure, governed by the configuration and roads of
the country; therefore, it will usually happen that the
length of the lead cannot be reduced, and the only resource is
to lessen the height of the tip, and, consequently, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>momentum of the earth down the slope, and to reduce the
inclination of the temporary road at the tip head to that sufficient
to cause the contents of a waggon to be freely ejected
and no more. This cannot be effected at the same cost as
depositing an embankment to the full height, although in
the case of an uphill lead a down gradient upon which the
waggons will run freely by force of gravity can be made
from the commencement of a cutting to the required width,
the embankment being raised to its desired height without
extra expense but assuming the case of an embankment
60 feet in height, and that in order to make it as dense and
firm as possible it has to be tipped in three heights averaging
20 feet, it involves the laying, maintaining, and removal of
three temporary roads instead of one, and cannot be erected
without extra expenditure. The large majority of railway
embankments have been deposited to the full height and
width, and they stand; although the effect of tipping loose
soil upon loose soil, which has not had time to consolidate, is
at each addition to cause a movement of the surface. It is
obvious the higher the tip the greater the disturbance, but
it may be said in firm and hard granular earth, if always
dry, this unbinding, although temporarily a disturbing
element, may really tend to produce ultimate homogeneity
and stability; on the other hand, in tipping dry clay from a
considerable height it often separates and becomes loose and
mere dust.</p>

<p class='c000'>In an embankment of moderate height the day’s excavation
from a cutting will increase its length several yards, and the
material from each set of waggons will only be exposed to
the weather for a short time. On the contrary, in a high
embankment, the effect of the deposition of the contents of a
set of waggons upon the tip head is hardly perceptible, and is,
until the toe of the slope is approached, the superimposition
of a thin layer of earth which a shower of rain can convert
into mud or cause to be in a soft or disunited condition,
especially in the case of soils having easily soluble particles.
The deteriorating influence of high deposition may be judged
from the closing of an embankment of considerable height, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>it is often a tedious and somewhat anxious undertaking, as
might be expected from excavated, shaken, and loosened earth
being deposited upon soil in a similar condition, instead of
upon the solid ground like the other portions of an embankment.
Also water frequently percolates and trickles down
the approaching slopes, and penetrates them and loosens the
soil, whereas if one tip is proceeding, any surface waters may
flow away upon the slope and the solid ground, and the
earth has time to become in a similar state throughout. To
lessen these disintegrating effects, if it can be done without
interfering with the due progress of the works, it is well to
allow one tip end to consolidate for some time, and to
complete the closure of the embankment solely from the
other, suitable means being adopted to effect a firm junction.
Should closing from a single tip head be impracticable, the
earth from the meeting point of the toe of the slopes of the
tip heads should be similar in character and be deposited in
the same condition; in any case additional care should be
taken to adopt every reasonable precaution to secure equal
consolidation. As evidence of the dissipation of earth at and
near to the junction of two high tip heads may be stated that
they require more material to close them than would appear
to be necessary from a computation based upon measurements
taken from cross sections. In non-granular earths few cases
will occur in which high tipping is an advantage; one of
the few is when loose rock and firm earth are deposited, then
the rock having larger particles, and consequently being
heavier, will roll to the foot of the tip before the smaller
material, and so form a broken stone seat for the embankment.
In granular earths, such as gravel or sand, the height of a
tip head is not a matter requiring much careful attention, as
the particles are not deleteriously affected by water. When
they are of nearly equal size, an embankment will settle
equally, but in gravelly sand the stone will separate to some
extent during transit and the process of deposition will be at
the base; a varying slope may then be assumed, and it may
here be named that it is known when sand is differently
deposited, although its appearance is unaltered, it will exert
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>dissimilar thrusts. An embankment of little height may be
deposited in bad weather without slipping or subsidence, but
when a high embankment is similarly tipped the surface
of the earth is in an unfit state, and operations should be
suspended for a few days.</p>

<p class='c000'>With regard to the systems of tipping and the prevention
of slips, as a general rule an embankment should be
deposited to the full width, for if it be not erected at one
operation the earth may be of a different character in diverse
conditions, and will be more exposed to the vicissitudes of
weather; and in wide embankments, should the system be
adopted of tipping two outer roads and one central road, the
three tips should equally proceed in order that the earth may
be in a similar state and be subject to equal exposure; or
weathered surfaces will be created down which water will
more easily percolate than through the solid mass. In the
three tip system the two sides have a tendency to lean
towards each other, and cause the greatest pressure to be
upon the inner material during construction, and therefore
the embankment is supposed to be more consolidated and less
likely to slip; but, unless the conditions are exactly similar,
the advantage of this arrangement is more fanciful than real,
for should the inside slopes of the outer roads meet first, the
earth deposited from the centre tip has not an equal distance
to descend and, therefore, the mass has not been tipped from
the same height, the looser material, temporarily or permanently,
being upon the outer tips and the denser in the
centre; whereas the slopes, being the most exposed, should be
the more compact, and when they settle towards the centre
without an outward movement at the foot, so much the
better for the stability of the embankment. The pressure
upon the seat is more regular when it is deposited to the full
width, as weight is then not irregularly added, probably
after some settlement. Instead of dividing the tips into two
outer roads and one central road, and in that way endeavouring
to obtain permanent stability, it is better to diminish the
height the earth has to be cast, and to deposit it as far as
practicable in lifts, and to the full width. In treacherous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>soils such as some of the clays, embankments that would not
stand at a depth of 30 feet have been permanently stable when
the seat was drained, and they were tipped in lifts of 15 to
20 feet in soft clay, and 20 to 25 feet in firmer clay, at double
the height at which they previously slipped.</p>

<p class='c000'>This method involves the expense of moving the temporary
roads, but allows more time for subsidence, and the mass of an
embankment is not so exposed to the weather; however, in a
dry season, an embankment can often be tipped to the full
height, whereas in wet or changeable weather it would not
stand if so deposited, and two lifts may be required. Care
should be taken that the width is always sufficient to receive
the top lift. It is more in the direction of equally reducing
the height the material has to be tipped, especially in
treacherous soils, that solidity is to be attained, than in an
attempt to consolidate earth by endeavouring to cause it to
fall together by deposition from two or more separate parallel
roads at the same level.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many slips and failures of embankments have been caused
by the central portion being deposited of one material, such
as clay, and the slopes afterwards made of a different earth,
as rock. The latter will then slip upon the greasy surface
of the clay, the porous nature of the broken rock readily
admitting water and air. In fact, a more flagrant example
of effecting that which on no account should be done is not
easy to imagine. In treacherous soil the system of tipping
an embankment wider than that required from considerations
of lateral and vertical settlement, and allowing it to
stand at a steeper slope than its permanent angle of repose,
and paring down the top unnecessary width is not to be
commended, as the earth is then strained, and the lower
portion is in the looser condition and the toe the weakest
part: however, in the construction of a single line of
railway with a narrow formation width, it is very convenient
as affording room for roads for loaded and empty waggons,
and in any soils other than aluminous and calcareous earths
it may be done with impunity, provided all slimy and
slippery surfaces are removed. No side tipping should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>allowed in depositing a new embankment, and any addition
of soil to a slope should be avoided as much as practicable,
although in trimming some filling may be necessary, but
the slopes should be rough trimmed by the bank-head men
as the earth is deposited so as to prevent hollows and
depressions, form a comparatively even and regular surface,
cause the mass to be equally exposed to the weather, and
prevent any lodgment of water. The form a tip head
naturally assumes will afford some indication of the
stability, for should it be regular and approach a semicircular
shape it shows the earth is of a comparatively
uniform character and is subsiding equally. When it is
uneven and jagged, with streaks down the tip, it indicates
unevenness of soil and condition.</p>

<p class='c000'>Circumstances arise which necessitate a departure from
any generally approved method, for frequently an embankment
must be widened to provide for increased traffic, and
tipping upon a consolidated surface must be effected.
Chapter VIII. and this refer to such a condition of work.
It sometimes occurs when a slip has taken place that only
a narrow tip can be adopted, as the soil may not temporarily
be able to bear the weight of a larger mass unless equally
diffused; then there is no other reasonable course to pursue
than to complete an embankment to the required width and
slopes by dry side-filling, such as ashes, broken bricks,
or other absorbent firm material regularly and carefully
deposited. In order to prevent slips and subsidence and
increase friction, when an embankment must be widened by
tipping upon its side, the existing slope should be stripped
of all turf or covering, but only so as to leave no uncovered
surface exposed to the weather; and the bared earth should
be made to present an even surface. When the slope is
benched, care should be taken that the benchings do not
localise water, and that it cannot percolate down the face
of the old bank at its point of junction with the new; also
in tipping an embankment upon sidelong ground or upon
the slope of an old bank, the seat should be bared,
particularly on the lower side, as the earth meets with no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>resistance from the ground except from friction; but upon
the upper side, the material being tipped partly against the
hill has a less distance to travel, and, therefore, the upper
or lesser slope is not so loose as the lower or longer slope,
which latter is the more likely to admit water, and requires
a flatter inclination than the denser portion of the embankment.
In the absence of other protective works, it is
advisable to form on the lower side an earth wall or counterfort
covered with turf at the toe of the slope in advance of
the tip, and to make it of the hardest and largest material
deposited and with a foundation upon bared soil, as it is
the part most liable to injury. This is a simple precaution
against slips, and will save its cost in lessening the expense
of repairing and trimming the slopes.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the steam navvy or excavator has now become
necessary plant upon most large public works, and greatly
accelerates the speed at which cuttings can be executed,
always provided the excavation is not of a treacherous
nature, and is in such quantity that if not so used it would
have to be run to spoil, many narrow valleys in the near
future will probably be wholly or nearly closed with an
earthen embankment, thereby effecting an important saving
of time and expense; or the number of spans of a viaduct
will be lessened, and only made sufficient to cross a road or
allow the required waterway for a river or the discharge
of any drainage or surface waters. The tendency, therefore,
will be to increase the height of embankments of
earth; and in countries where the first cost of an iron,
masonry, or brickwork viaduct is too great, and the use
of timber rendered necessary, earth embankments, except
in treacherous soil or upon soft ground, are to be preferred
to wooden pile and trestle bridges or culverts, whose
average life in America, which probably now possesses as
many as all other countries, is from eight to ten years, and
that of timber truss bridges nine to eleven years.</p>

<p class='c000'>In addition to other recommendations, the steam navvy
usually excavates the earth in small pieces of nearly
uniform size, and as it will perform the work of many men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>it may be most useful in treacherous soil, as it may enable
a cutting to be excavated in dry weather and be protected
before the commencement of the wet season. The slopes
should be excavated in such earth as soon as possible after
the gullet has been removed so as to prevent a slip, and it
may be necessary to close-sleeper or consolidate the ground
in order that the weight of the machine can be supported
upon soft ground.</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Notes upon the Location, Preservation, and Protection of Sea,
Estuary, Reclamation, Canal, and Reservoir Embankments of
Earth constructed to Contain or Expel Water.</span></p>

<p class='c005'>In the first place, care should be taken in determining the
site of an embankment across an estuary that there shall be
no concentration or alteration of the general direction of the
currents, or scouring action will be created; for the erosive
and other deleterious effects of wave action upon a shore are
influenced by the angle at which they are impelled against
it. A prudent course to adopt is to carefully preserve the
usual channels by means of bridges, particularly in ground
of a loose character, such as is usually found in partly landlocked
waters; for if the velocity is increased, the earth
which has been deposited by the original current being
reduced or impeded resulting in the suspended matter in the
water falling to the bottom, will be subject to a force that
will again disturb and cause it to return to its previous
suspensory condition; and any disturbance of the normal
currents may destroy the equilibrium of stability and alter
the flow, and when they are affected it may be most
difficult to restore them to their original state, for water will
always endeavour to obtain the easiest channel.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is essential to know the heaviest flood discharge of
any river that may flow into an estuary, the greatest depth
and velocity of the river, the normal and flood channels,
their sectional area and direction, and the extent and shape
of the catchment area, so as to establish the required opening
to give the natural waterway; for it is important not to
interfere with the tidal capacity of an estuary or the volume
or flow of any upland waters into the sea, as a navigable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>channel may become filled with silt, especially when the
shore is flat or sandbanks exist; and upon a sandy coast
an embankment across an estuary with openings for a
navigable channel will probably cause it to become difficult
to navigate and, perhaps, impossible, without constant
dredging and other works of maintenance, as an embankment
may obstruct and deflect the currents and prevent
them carrying away the suspended matter. An open
viaduct instead of an embankment is almost always to be
preferred, and may be necessary; for the power of a current
to scour or move particles is greatly augmented by a small
increase of the velocity, and the earth may be in such a
delicately balanced condition that any increase of scouring
action may destroy the seat of an embankment.</p>

<p class='c000'>To prevent leakage and scour of the base of an embankment
near a river resting upon loose soil, curtain walls are
sometimes inserted upon both sides extending to a considerable
depth, thereby affording security against an
embankment merely resting upon a mound which may
gradually erode, with the result that it must finally slip
and be destroyed; and it may happen, unless the foundations
are carried down into impervious soil, that water may escape
underneath and undermine it; such action is obstructed by
carrying the slopes a few feet below the ground so as to
prevent through surface percolation.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a rule, an embankment across an estuary with one or
two openings in it is to be avoided, and it should be most
carefully considered whether it will not be better to expend
a larger sum and erect a pile viaduct which will not
interfere with the currents or channels and only require
ordinary precautions to be taken against erosion, instead of
depositing an embankment with openings at the channels
and the necessary protective works which may consist of
pitching the slopes, covering them with fascines, mattress
work, or sods, erecting short or long, low or high, groynes,
as the former may be ineffectual in causing a deposit or a
shoal in front of the toe of the slope and in preventing
scour, for in loose silty and sandy soil of considerable depth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>and not sufficiently firm to resist erosion, they will probably
fail by reason of the space between them being washed
away; and a complete covering of the foreshore may be
requisite, or a protecting apron of homogeneous impermeable
soil, and continuous training walls to prevent the
creation of shoals: all of which protective works will
constantly need to be repaired, and the failure of any one
may cause not only an embankment to give way but the
remaining preservative works. Undoubtedly there are
many estuaries upon which if an embankment even with
many openings for channels had been deposited, it would
have failed, the soil being in such a tender state that the
least additional weight upon the surface would destroy the
equilibrium. Also interference with the littoral currents is
a risky operation in any but a hard rock bed as regards the
foundations, quite apart from injury to navigable channels.
When there are numerous ditches, creeks, or channels
crossing the line of a proposed estuary embankment of
variable stability, especially should hills be near and the
earth be so porous as to be saturated every tide, without
doubt the safer plan is to erect a low viaduct, as the old
waterways will be an endless source of trouble should the
ground be anything but firm clay, and interference with
the currents will not be preventable, as either their
velocity will be increased or decreased, the result being
scour or fresh deposits which will affect the channels; and
such alteration may change the direction of the motion of
the waters, which must be prevented in front of an estuary
embankment; or waves will be created by the water
travelling and rushing over shoals, for the even configuration
of the bottom is a wave lessener, and should
there be a deep channel near an estuary embankment
severe wave action may be created. The piers or piles of
such a viaduct should be cylindrical, thus offering no flat
surface for the waves to break against, and yet temporarily
to divide them without serious shock to a structure. When
of very considerable length, a projecting embankment
deposited upon a flat shore of a tidal estuary has caused a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>heaping up of the water on one side at low tide, and
therefore it is unequally strained. This was found to be
the case with an estuary embankment on the Scheldt, 2½
miles in length.</p>

<p class='c000'>The form of the slope has also to be considered, but
all the principles that determine the best profile in each
case of a pier or breakwater do not necessarily apply to an
embankment in an estuary. The recoil of the waves
washing away the ground in front and at the toe is
particularly to be guarded against, and the action of spray
or a broken mass of water falling upon the formation, as also
the direct action of the waves. A concave form should not
be adopted throughout, as waves roll up until they approach
the top portion, when they turn over and fall upon the
flatter portion and often breach it, but when the face is
straight, excepting for a few feet at the toe, the waves are
diffused in travelling up, although they proceed to a higher
point upon a flat slope than a steep one, and the recoil
is greatly diminished, but with the view of avoiding direct
wave action, when the ground is inclined in front of a sea
or estuary embankment, it is well to curve the lower part
of the slope and to make it cycloidal to the surface of the
ground and the slope for a little distance, so as to reduce
obstruction to a minimum. The method of making a level
terrace or stepping the slope instead of a curved face has
the advantage of checking the rising of the sea up the face,
altering its direction and acting as a wave-breaker, and also
combines these effects with giving as large an area of the
base as can be obtained by a curved face, and in bringing
the centre of gravity of the cross section of the embankment
nearer to the seat, but the face must be securely protected.
The width of the cess should increase according to the
degree of exposure. If an embankment consists of earth
the slope of the cess should be from 6 to 10 to 1, or the
system is better avoided and a continuous face adopted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Short groynes will often protect the toe of an embankment
and prevent any longitudinal current undermining it.
As a rule, in a tidal estuary the cost of protecting the slopes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>is considerable, and more above low-water level than below
it. In adopting groynes formed of single or double rows
of piles, in order to prevent erosion of the toe and a slip and
subsidence in an estuary or sea embankment, the littoral
currents must be considered before determining their
direction and position, the object of their erection being
to prevent the waves, and especially the prevailing waves,
from scouring the shore, and also to cause a general
deposition of shingle, and, therefore, they are usually placed
at an angle to the set of the waves, so as to cause the latter
to be diffused. The angle will vary; the best guide is to
examine the effects of any that may be erected in a similar
position to that to be built. An angle of 50° to 70° with
the foreshore, in a leeward direction is frequently adopted,
and with respect to the distance apart, this depends principally
upon the direction of the current and prevailing
wind, contour of the shore, degree of exposure, and the
length of the groynes. When the whole of an open coast
has to be protected, no natural defence existing, the line
of the prevailing set of the current and wind on a straight
shore can be set off at the end of a groyne, and before the
point at which it meets the foreshore another can be erected.
They are generally successful when properly placed, and are
most frequently straight; if not, they have a concave face to
the direction of maximum eroding force; a convex must be
avoided, as it will not permanently retain the deposits; their
practical effect being that the breach is heaped up or
retained upon the prevailing wind, set of current, or wind-wave
side to a height of some feet above the leeward side,
therefore, a groyne should be so constructed that planks
can be added to it as required. They have been proved
to prevent the formation of bars when judiciously located,
but their success greatly depends upon their proper position
and direction, or in loose soils such as sand they may cause
a deposit upon the windward and prevailing current side,
but an erosion and falling away upon the other; and when
placed in front of a reclamation embankment upon shifting
sand until the ground at the back of the embankment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>becomes dry by the tidal waters being excluded, or the
surface is impermeably coated, they may be of comparatively
little use to prevent a slip or movement of the shore; for as
the tide recedes below the level of the toe of the slope, a
seaward flow of the tidal and land waters will be created in
very porous soil under the seat of an embankment, and may
continue until the tide returns and rises to the level of the
ground, thus causing the shore to be constantly changing
place and permanently established accumulation impossible.
Short transverse spurs have been adopted to lessen this action
but their effect is hardly noticeable. As failure of a groyne
will probably cause erosion of the foot of an embankment
and a slip, a cheap and effective means, attested by the
experience of nearly half a century, of preserving the
timber from the attacks of most marine worms may here be
named. It consists in scorching the piles, thus preventing
fermentation of the sap, and immediately tarring them: also
in placing the wood in the opposite direction to that in which
it grew; the latter operation has been found to increase the
durability 50 per cent., the reason, it is believed, being that
the capillary tubes in the trees are so adjusted as to oppose
the rising of moisture when the wood is inverted.</p>

<p class='c000'>In excavating for an enclosure embankment, the earth
should not be disturbed nearer than is economically necessary,
and a cess should be left of about 40 to 50 feet in loose
permeable soil, the width being governed by the character
of the earth, the depth of the excavation, and the height of
the embankment. Should dredging have to be executed
near an embankment, a considerable distance should be left
between the toe of the slope and the line of operations.
Before commencing an estuary or enclosure embankment,
it is advisable to notice whether a deposit is left upon the
shore by the incoming tide, and to ascertain whether it forms
in some degree a protective covering, for if this should be
the case, any increase of the velocity of the flowing water
which might be caused by dredging or a concentration of
the littoral currents should be avoided, or the tidal matter
in a state of suspension will not gradually sink to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>ground. The tidal deposit, although the earth forming the
embankment should not be tipped upon it, may also be of
importance as tending to prevent or lessen any percolation
of water through the foreshore and under the seat of an
embankment; for instance, on the Nile, the deposited slime
is found to make a practically watertight covering on the
loose sand. Mr. Thomas Stevenson has also stated that,
according to the depth below the surface of low water that
mud reposes, may be approximately judged the force of wave
disturbance and degree of exposure; the less the depth, the
less the power possessed by the waves.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the case of treacherous soil which circumstances compelled
to be partly used in a reclamation embankment of
moderate height, but which it was found would gradually
become firm by compression, rough sheet piles with a
plank at top have been inserted, giving the outline of the
finished slope of the material to be afterwards tipped
upon it, the piles and planking not being removed, and,
therefore, affording the required temporary support before
the earth became consolidated and stable by compression
and time.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Chapter IX. the deposition of embankments is referred
to as it affects slips and subsidences in earthwork, but in an
enclosure embankment an additional precaution is particularly
necessary, namely, that immediately tipping from the ends
increases the velocity of the flow of the outgoing or
incoming tidal water through the opening, and consequently
augments its scouring action; its deposition from a spurn
head should be abandoned, and the embankment be uniformly
raised from the base. The employment of cofferdams,
piling and planking for effecting a closure is now generally
discarded in favour of the horizontal system of equally
raising the height of an embankment from its base; and is
even to be preferred to fascines, unless the latter are merely
used to distribute the weight over the base, to protect the
surface of a slope, or form a shield against scour either
temporarily or permanently.</p>

<p class='c000'>In previous chapters the protection of a slope is examined;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>here some reference is made to the particular preservation
of the slopes of an estuary or reclamation embankment.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the protection afforded is not uniform care must be
taken that although it makes one part secure it does not
weaken another. In the case of river-banks in a soil that is
in a delicate state of equilibrium, it may occur that soon after
one portion has been protected, another is being scoured,
whereas previously it was stable; therefore, to prevent
localization of the erosive action, whether on the foreshore
of an estuary, reclamation, or a river-bank, and consequent
slips and subsidences, the covering should extend over a
considerable length. In a sheltered position simply sodding
the slopes may be effectual. Some other means of protection
are a hard chalk or gravel counterfort founded a few feet
below the ground at the toe of an embankment, and a
covering of similar chalk or gravel upon the slope, should
the soil be favourable. When an embankment of earth in
an estuary or river is of firm soil and only requires to be
made proof against wave action, stones may be simply
deposited evenly upon a slope and so that they will not be
washed out, and pitching be not required, as the rough face
will tend to break up the waves; but where a simple
covering is adopted, whether close or comparatively loose, the
slope should be straight, as a concave form causing a recoil
of the waves will in time damage or separate the face shield.
A coating of clay about 2 feet in thickness, upon a slope
with stakes driven into it, and large bushy boughs of trees
fixed thereon with the tops downwards, is frequently used
in India as a protective cover to a crumbling bank of a river,
and to training spurs erected to prevent erosion and slips.
Mattresses, fascine or wattled work, besides being expensive,
will slide down a slope unless well secured to it, and
therefore a constant strain is produced as in all stake-held
coverings; it has also been observed by the experienced that
although so largely and successfully used in Holland and on
its coast, there is very little ground swell on the Dutch
shores, and that in a very exposed situation, or where heavy
ground swells exist, they may not answer, and may become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>disintegrated by the much greater weight and force of the
sea; and this, notwithstanding the surface breakers of thin
water and little mass broken up by the wind may produce
more visible agitation.</p>

<p class='c000'>To prevent a river-bank slipping, and also to maintain a
channel in a muddy river, half-tide longitudinal training
walls made of wattled work or fascines have been used, so
as to cause the deposition of the suspended matter in the
tidal water and to gradually restore the impaired slope and
secure it from crumbling into the river. The stones brought
down by heavy floods have also been used to maintain a
river channel and protect its banks from slipping, the
interstices gradually becoming filled with mud deposited by
the water when the floods subside.</p>

<p class='c000'>When sudden and unexpected scour of the slope or bed
near an estuary embankment upon soft soil has to be
immediately arrested to prevent a slip, gunny bags filled
with sand afford a ready means of repairing any cavities,
the interstices between the bags usually being filled rapidly.
Material should be added as required and any concentration
of the erosive currents should be avoided.</p>

<p class='c000'>The required height has to be determined of an embankment
in an estuary or the sea to prevent any flow over it
or waves falling upon the inner slope; 4 to 5 feet above
the highest water mark appears to be adopted in the lower
reaches of the Thames and unexposed estuaries in England.
In Holland 10 to 15 feet, depending upon the degree of
exposure. It is of paramount importance to prevent any
waves washing over the top, as damage and, perhaps, a
breach may be caused thereby. The height of the highest
known wave must therefore be ascertained.</p>

<p class='c000'>Should the shore be sandy and loose, a characteristic of
estuarine accumulations, although its usual bed may be
preserved in any storm, when an embankment is erected
the rapid and ceaseless process of wasting of the sand and
loose soil by the recoil of the waves from the face may in
time lay bare the toe of a steep slope and undermine it; for
it has been found where the foundation was sand and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>rubble mound, which should be so constructed that its
interstices become filled in order to make it more solid and
stable, was placed upon it, and the superstructure upon
the mound, that the sea being resisted by a vertical wall
recoiled and made the soil a quicksand, although the sand
would be stable at its natural slope in still water.
Obviously the less the action of the waves is impeded,
the less the looseness of the sand. Experiments have
shown that a slope of 1 to 1 will reflect waves, on a flatter
slope they are broken. In such situations light structures,
offering little resistance to the action of the waves and not
causing an impediment to the current, should be adopted
in preference to a massive or solid erection; but when an
embankment is necessary, it should have a long sloping
mound or foreshore upon which the waves will gradually
become lessened and dispersed, the desired object being to
prevent deep water close to the work. When a railway
or road follows the shore, instead of erecting a retaining
wall to protect an embankment, a preferable plan to adopt
may be to have open trestle-work offering the least possible
obstruction, and when the formation is at the base of a cliff
of variable and doubtful soil it is the best construction, as
the cliff is not touched, and slips and subsidences are
avoided. Should the deposition of an artificial beach
be considered necessary for the preservation of the foot of
a cliff in addition to the trestle road, experience seems to
indicate that the contour affording the most protection
is one in which the slope has a flat terrace or cess at not
above three-fourths of the vertical height, another short
slope, and a nearly horizontal space some distance from the
foot of the cliff; but a storm will straighten the face, and it
may be impossible to economically maintain it; however,
should such a slope be assumed it should not be disturbed.
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vide</span></i> Chapter VI. for information respecting slopes. When
a sea or an estuary retaining wall is necessary in order to
prevent the slipping of an embankment consisting of loose
soil, an inner dwarf wall at the edge of the formation upon
the land side should be erected so as to hold the embankment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>in a box, and not allow
any spray or water passing over
the retaining wall to erode the
inner portion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Deep water is generally required
close to the work in railway
piers or jetties to enable
vessels to get alongside; a heavy
and monolithic wall must consequently
be erected; however,
in the case of loose soil, the
vertical system simply should
not be used unless the foundation
is thoroughly protected and
below the reach or effect of wave
action, and no re-entering or
right angles should exist, as
they increase the action of the
waves. When a rubble mound
is cast in and a vertical structure
placed thereon, great care
must be taken that there are no
holes, except the natural interstices
between the stones, and
that they have a firm foundation
and sink equally, or the random
mound may give way and the
superstructure will then necessarily
follow.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>As an illustration of the deleterious
effects of the recoil of
waves may be mentioned that a
high vertical wall with a parapet
has been found to endanger the
toe, but when the parapet has
been removed in order to allow
the head of the waves to leap
over the top of the work, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>structure remained stable. To prevent the recoil of the sea
and the scooping away of the base and the foreshore in much
exposed situations, and consequent slips and subsidences, breakwaters
which simply act as wave screens, and not as wind
screens, are sometimes kept a little below high-water mark so
that the heads of the waves may have free action, although
their onward motion is prevented. On the contrary, light
open work, such as a lattice screen, although it may somewhat
lessen wave action, does not prevent it passing through.</p>

<p class='c000'>The principal causes of the failure of vertical walls when
placed upon an easily eroded foundation are by the scouring
action of the recoiling waves, therefore their magnitude
should be reduced to the lowest limit: by the impounded
air driving out particles of the structure: by waves
travelling upon the top, therefore their forward motion
should be deflected and rendered vertical: by the hammering
action of the mass caused by its being alternately
quickly submerged and unsubmerged; the practical effect
being that the foundation is intermittingly released of a
portion of the load and then fully strained, therefore the
height of the waves should be reduced as much as possible.
Respecting the action of falling water, experiments were
recently made in India, which proved that “the greatest
intensity of pressure does not exceed that due to a column of
water of a height equal to the fall;” the greatest intensity of
pressure being always fractionally under the hydrostatic head.</p>

<p class='c000'>The weight, 1·05 ton upon each slope, of the water upon

<p class='c000'>This wave action may, and generally will, happen upon
one side only of an embankment owing to the direction of
the wind, the current, and the “fetch” of the water. In
that event the lateral pressure upon the embankment will also
constantly change, and there will be a varying horizontal
force from the 5 feet in height wave and its percussive
action upon the slope tending to produce unequal strain
and movement.</p>

<p class='c000'>The object of the preceding calculations is to show <em>the
variation of pressures</em> an embankment in an estuary or a tidal
river has to sustain in addition to those of an ordinary
embankment upon dry land, and its especial liability to slip
and subside; and also to demonstrate that the vertical and
necessarily the horizontal pressures may be in a perpetual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>state of mutation and vary considerably, and that the
vertical pressure of the water outside an enclosure embankment
may reach a point when the water may be forced
upward upon the land side. Usually, subsidence is greatest
in the wet seasons and at the time of the lowest tides.</p>

<p class='c000'>In choosing between two materials for submerged work
practically equal in other respects, the heavier should be
preferred, as by reason of its own weight it has greater
power to resist the action of the waves and scour, and the
decrease of its specific gravity by the weight of the bulk of
water displaced is relatively not so large.</p>

<p class='c000'>With respect to the earthwork of canals and embankments
constructed to hold water, each chapter of this book contains
information relating to the promotion of the stability of the
soil, and it is not here intended to refer to the most approved
methods of construction, but only to name some points
requiring attention.</p>

<p class='c000'>A barge or ordinary ship canal is usually placed at a
shallow depth in the ground and meanders through a district,
avoiding deep cuttings and heavy embankments, such
an undertaking as the Suez, or the Panama, ship canals
being altogether exceptional undertakings; and also the
Manchester Ship Canal. Some of the most treacherous soils
are named in Chapter II., but probably the worst earth in
which a canal can be made is peat-bog land; the method of
procedure is then different to that required in making a
railway or a road, and in such soil the construction of a
canal should be avoided, as it necessitates most experienced
and skilful treatment and extensive drainage, which causes
subsidence; difficult maintenance to preserve the channel and
retain the water of navigation, control the drainage waters,
and keep unimpaired the towing-path, which must be firmly
covered throughout. Fine sand is also an unfavourable soil
as it so readily becomes a quicksand, but almost all other
earths usually met with can be so protected that failure
should be an improbable contingency, except when the
cuttings are of extraordinary depth, as on the Panama Canal;
the chief danger being when there is considerable diversity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>irregularity, fissuring, looseness, and upheaval of the soil, for
varieties of almost every surface earth may be encountered,
each with its own characteristics and behaviour when dry or
water-charged, and requiring great attention, especially at
the joints, and not a few separate treatment, not only of the soil
but of the same earth in a cutting and in an embankment.</p>

<p class='c000'>It sometimes happens that there is not enough clayey
earth to form a canal bank, but if the whole of the excavation,
except the mere surface earth, is used there is sufficient, and
that it must be employed for reasons of economical construction.
In such a case the clayey earth should be deposited
upon the water side, and the gravelly or sandy soil on the land
side and as a towing-path covering, great care being exercised
that no stratification of the earth takes place, or it may
separate, and water seams be created. The bottom and
slopes of a canal embankment must be covered with an
impervious layer, puddle or concrete being most frequently
used for the bottom, and puddle or a coating of well rammed
vegetable soil sown closely with grass seeds for the slopes, or
stone pitching in a wide canal liable to wash: also in loose
or doubtful soil. In canal cuttings when the water is drawn
off the counter-thrust against the slopes is removed, and
unless this is maintained the earth, if in a delicate or loosened
condition, may slip, as a flow may be caused of previously
dammed up waters. Prior to any works being commenced
upon a canal embankment it is advisable to strengthen it for
a distance of not less than about 60 feet in length on each
side of a proposed railway bridge or other structure, particularly
when it will be subject to vibration.</p>

<p class='c000'>Water will soon find a weak place in any earthwork and,
certainly, when an engineer can maintain heavy earthworks
in treacherous soils in canal construction, where part of one
slope is submerged in an embankment and the other dry,
and in a cutting part wet and part dry, he should be able to
do so in any analogous situation, making due provision for
vibration, the chief disturbing agency canals are not subject
to, but which is so potent in its effect upon railway earthwork.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>Canal and reservoir embankments are so similar as regards
the stability of earthwork that they are here considered under
one head. The object of a canal, reservoir, or river embankment
is in a desired position to hold water without leakage,
subsidence, or deterioration of the earth, or other works
connected with the general construction. In dock, canal,
or any earthworks made for the purpose of containing or expelling
water, it is obvious the position is entirely dissimilar
to that of railway works: for whereas a slip or a subsidence
in an embankment upon railway work may be of slight
moment and give comparatively little trouble or anxiety,
any movement in earthwork constructed for the purposes
named is of grave importance, as it may mean the destruction
of the work, loss of life and property, not only upon the site
but also in the surrounding district. No leakage or marked
weeping of such an embankment should be disregarded, as
unless arrested it will gradually deteriorate the earth until
the equilibrium becomes so affected that the embankment
fails. As a rule, upon railway works, serious slips, except in
very unstable soil, such as drift earth, or those quickly
decomposed by atmospheric influences, seldom occur, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vide</span></i>
Chapter II., until a year or two has elapsed, the process of
disintegration from water being necessarily slower in its
action, the material having an opportunity to return to its
normal condition, and the surface being more equally
exposed. In earthwork for hydraulic purposes, although not
subject to frequent and sudden vibration, the slopes being
unequally exposed and part generally either permanently or
temporarily submerged or alternately wet and dry, and the
top and land side unsubmerged and fully open to the action
of the weather, percolation cannot be equal and regular upon
its surfaces, and slips and subsidences therefore usually
occur within a short time, varying from a few weeks to a
few months; and after about a year or a cycle of seasons they
are not frequent, unless the inherent design and construction
of an embankment is faulty, permitting leakage through the
submerged slope or bottom, pools of water to collect upon the
top, and the bank to become fissured and unequally wet or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>dry. Especial care should be exercised to ensure a complete
and impermeable connection with the earth upon which it is
placed.</p>

<p class='c000'>In embankments to contain or expel water time should
always be allowed for an embankment to consolidate before
the admission of the water, but in the case of a cutting the
presence of the navigation water as soon after construction
as practicable may be an advantage, depending upon the
nature of the earth in each case; as it may protect the
submerged portions of the slopes from the deteriorating effects
of being in a constantly changing degree of dryness and
wetness, and shield them from the sun and drying winds.
Except under peculiar circumstances the unstable places will
be known in a few months, and provided a canal is properly
constructed, it will not cause much trouble after six months
or a year from earthwork movement if the embankments and
cuttings receive ordinary attention, as the navigation water
will quickly indicate the unconsolidated places. In clay,
clay marls, clay loams, and where loamy soil is intermixed
with permeable and water-bearing strata, movement of the
earth in canals will speedily occur unless proper precautions
have been taken in the construction, as they are seldom
homogeneous.</p>

<p class='c000'>Earthworks to contain or expel water should be made
proof against even improbable deterioration and accident,
and in proportion as the soil is less solid and firm it should
be consolidated by ramming or other means, or be covered
and protected to prevent it cracking, and only firm and
binding material should be used in canal embankments or
those holding or expelling water in order to prevent slips
and subsidences. Chapter II. treats of some conditions under
which slips and subsidences may be expected. No precaution
should be omitted that will render the work solid
and uniform, and nothing should be left to chance. The
location is of great importance, for the earth may vary in
stability within a very short distance, not only in character
but as regards the superimposition of the strata. Upheaved
and distorted beds should be avoided, and all loose and fissured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>earths, especially rock or other soils having more or less
vertical seams: for all embankments constructed upon
fissured soils are sure to cause anxiety and trouble, and will
always be liable to become in a dangerous state from an
excessive rainfall. Impermeable horizontally deposited earth
of considerable thickness is that to be desired, or firm ground
that cannot slide upon another stratum or be affected by any
artificially brought addition to the percolating waters consequent
upon the construction of waterworks. Having carefully
selected a site, which for waterworks purposes must
almost invariably be upon high ground and may have to be
upon the top cap soil of a hill and be peculiarly exposed, the
next step to guard against a slip or a subsidence is to prepare
the foundations so that no leakage or trickling of water can
undermine or gradually deteriorate the seat of the embankment;
and, therefore, a thorough connection between the
deposited embankment and the ground must be established
and the whole be prevented from movement.</p>

<p class='c000'>The selection of the best available earth is one requiring
careful consideration, and it may be necessary to experiment
to test the capability of the soil to be made watertight by
compression or other comparatively inexpensive means. In
some cases none may be obtainable; if so, the only course to
pursue may be to consolidate the earth as much as possible,
and protect it with an impermeable homogeneous and
durable covering, and one that experience has shown can be
trusted to equally resist percolation. The whole practice of
stable earth dam construction is comprised in the employment
of homogeneous, fine, and tenacious earth uniformly deposited
in thin layers, gently watered sufficiently to aid ramming
and consolidation, rolled, pressed, or trodden down by the
passage of carts, men, or animals, and in its due surface
protection. Heavy rolling is to be preferred, for it is more
effective than ramming, as may be judged by the greater
compression; the thickness of the layers and the weight
being so regulated that it compresses the earth to its state
of maximum solidity, and does not pulverize it, as the
compression is more uniform, and irregularly compact masses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>are not created, which not only destroy uniformity of condition
of the mass, but cause seams and veins and destroy
homogeneity. After rolling, the compressed layer should be
gently watered, as the weight of the roller will have made
the top crust drier than the lower portion, unless it has been
made into too moist a state. The thickness of the layers
should not exceed, when the soil is to be heavy steam-rolled,
about 6 inches in earth, and 4 inches in clay soils; they may
be compressed to about four-fifths to two-thirds of their
normal thickness, the degree of compression to ensure
maximum solidity indicating the openness of the original
earth. In sand, the layers when simply wetted and rammed
with an ordinary rammer, should be about 4 to 5 inches in
thickness, and ordinary earth about 2 inches. The volume
of the sand will be reduced from 10 to 15 per cent. Simple
ramming of sand will only reduce it about 6 to about 9 per
cent., and water about 4 to 6 per cent., making the total
compression as before stated, the quantity of water used
being some 20 per cent. of the volume of the sand.
Embankments of moderate height have been made of sand
when no other earth was available, except clay loamy soil in
comparatively small quantities, the surface of the embankment
being worked by thin bars, and the loam being
incorporated with the sand and made to fill its interstices,
surface protection being thus afforded, and all the usual
means to promote consolidation being adopted. Wet earth
well mixed with a grout of quicklime has also been used to
make a firm embankment of little height. Clay is not a
good material to use unless it is incorporated with a considerable
percentage of sand to prevent fissures and to lessen
expansion. Many prefer the sand to be in the proportion of
about two-thirds of the mass, only one-third being clay; the
soil being then a loam, and cannot be classed as a clay.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is much diversity of opinion as to the relative value
of a central puddle wall or protection of the slope and toe.
Such a wall is placed in the centre, not only to give support
to an earth embankment and prevent any through leakage,
but also to keep the puddle in a uniformly moist condition,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>and therefore to prevent it fissuring and cracking from
exposure to the sun or air. In an embankment erected upon
an earth foundation it may be advantageous and warrant
the expense, but when the embankment of earth is placed
upon rock it should not be erected, for it is impossible to
make a watertight joint between rock and clay puddle,
and should it be placed in a rock trench leakage will not
be prevented by it, and water will accumulate when it does
not at once pass through the seat of an embankment until
the surface of its base becomes softened, and the whole
mass almost worthless either as a means of support or of
prevention of through percolation; and, moreover, there
is the danger that the clay will draw away from the sides
of the rock. What is wanted is, as it were, to insert as
far as the top of an embankment an artificial rock having
a thorough connection with the foundation, consequently
a Portland cement concrete wall should be adopted in such
a case and not one consisting of clay puddle. Two great
advantages of a Portland cement concrete central support
over that of a clay puddle wall are that it does not settle
and the weight is evenly distributed, whereas a puddle wall
in subsiding may draw away from the earth of the embankment
and cause cavities and cracks and consequent leakage.
The chief consideration is to produce an embankment having
impermeability, solidity, and homogeneity, and a thorough
connection at the foundations; and as the central puddle
wall system rarely does so, and usually only under
circumstances which would probably hardly warrant the
expense of its adoption, it is in a state of obsolescence; and
should central wall support be necessary, which may not
infrequently be the case, Portland cement concrete is
being adopted in its place, a solid and durable material
being used instead of one varying in shape and size,
according to its state of dryness or wetness, liable to fissure,
and incapable of being permanently and firmly joined to
any material. This system may be described as one of
arresting the percolation of water in the interior of an
embankment; but the great aim is to prevent any percolation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>into the mass, as when once a passage is made the water
will escape along the line of least resistance, and a fissure
become a cavity, a cavity a breach.</p>

<p class='c000'>The protection of the slope and toe has for its object the
prevention of any percolation into the mass, and it may
effect all that is requisite, but its efficiency and completeness
much depends upon the preparation and deposition of the
layers during the construction of an embankment, and also
the time that can be allowed for consolidation, so as to
prevent any cracking or fissuring of the face covering from
settlement of the embankment. It is obvious in the case
of a reservoir embankment or a slope alternately submerged
and unsubmerged, that an exposed clay puddle covering
cannot be used, as heat or the sun’s rays will cause it to
crack, although if constantly wet it would succeed. A
puddled clay covering with a broken stone bed placed upon
it to receive dry or mortar-set stone pitching has been
frequently adopted; a simple cement concrete facing about
6 to 12 inches in thickness, depending upon the depth of the
water and the nature of the soil, or in conjunction with an
asphalt coating of ordinary thickness. In the two latter
cases care must be taken that they do not separate from
the embankment either from the force of pent-up water,
frost, or shrinking of the earth embankment.</p>

<p class='c000'>As any perforation of the surface must be prevented,
in certain districts the covering should be capable of resisting
the attacks of rodents and crustacea, and, therefore, a
stone pitched or concrete covered slope is necessary, or the
puddle towards the surface must be well incorporated with
small stones or ashes or other tough material. In European
countries the effects of the burrowing of rats may be insignificant,
but in warmer climates, as, for instance, on the coast of
Coromandel and in some parts of Bengal, where rats may
measure as much as 2 feet in length, their attacks are not
to be disregarded with impunity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The causes of failure of water-containing embankments
afford an indication of the direction in which especial care
should be exercised in their construction. Assuming a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>reservoir embankment to be of the necessary form and
bulk, and to be properly constructed, the principal causes of
failure are as follows:—</p>

<p class='c000'>1.  Leakage along the line of a culvert or pipe passing
through the lower portion of an embankment.</p>

<p class='c000'>2.  Leakage under the seat of an embankment.</p>

<p class='c000'>3.  Water overflowing the top and eroding the land slope
and so destroying the equilibrium.</p>

<p class='c000'>4.  Bursting of springs over the site. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vide</span></i> Chapter XII.
on “boils” in loose soils.</p>

<p class='c000'>With regard to the first, the most frequent cause of the
failure of a water enclosure embankment; the culvert or
outlet passages have been rendered unnecessary by conducting
the waters in a tunnel passage under the seat
of the embankment and without interfering with it; but
this method is expensive. One of the causes of failure is
the weight of the embankment owing to unequal settlement
producing a breach in a culvert, the probable result of
insecure foundations or want of a firm concrete base to the
culvert to evenly distribute the weight; or it being placed
upon clay puddle, which should never be done; or the
embankment being constructed without due care. All culverts
should be sufficiently large for a man to easily pass
through and should be equally watertight within and
without, for a leakage from the culvert to the bank is
equally dangerous, and means should be provided so that it
can be closed in short lengths. Reports on the temporary
failures of reservoir embankments almost invariably state,
failure occurred from water penetrating between the puddle
and the culvert, from water percolating between the rock
foundation and the central puddle wall, or the embankment
gave way as water issued through interstices in it caused
by settlement of the masonry outlet passage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Careless construction has often been shown by inspection
to be the reason of so many embankments yielding along
the line of the culvert; but when the latter is properly
designed and built it seldom causes a temporary failure of a
well-made reservoir embankment.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>Respecting the second cause of failure, it generally proceeds
from want of care in thoroughly binding an embankment to
the solid ground and protecting the toe; by “boils” in the
foundations; or by a porous earth seam, such as fine
sand, existing under the stratum upon which the embankment
is erected becoming a quicksand on flowing water
reaching it.</p>

<p class='c000'>In connection with the third, it may be said that it is
not a frequent cause of failure, as provision is almost always
made to prevent it, but it may occur in a reservoir
embankment from extraordinary circumstances, or in a
much less degree from sufficiently high waves being
generated upon a lake or impounding reservoir that the top
of the bank may be loosened, and the water dash over it
and erode the land slope, and convert it into a kind of
tail-race; tarpaulins have been temporarily laid upon the
surface on an emergency to protect a soft place, also
sand bags and planking to prevent an overflow. In an
embankment erected for such a purpose the top width is
more severely strained, consequent upon the greater
exposure, than in a reservoir embankment, and the height
must be sufficient to prevent water passing over it.</p>

<p class='c000'>With reference to the fourth cause of failure, “boils” in
loose soil and the bursting of springs are referred to in
Chapter XII.</p>

<p class='c000'>When a reservoir is emptied the weight of the water on
its bottom is removed, but the load from the embankment is
the same, and should the ground be soft the embankment
may subside towards the reservoir and the bed be uplifted;
hence it may be advisable not to draw off the water unless
the bottom is weighted or movement prevented.</p>

<p class='c000'>Due regard of the different causes of failure herein
enumerated and care in construction, will reduce to a
minimum the probability of a slip or a subsidence in an
earth embankment erected to contain or expel water.</p>

<p class='c000'>The temporary or permanent diversion of rivers or streams
being so often necessary in public works, a few paragraphs
are here devoted to it so far as regards earthslips and subsidences.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>If it be possible when the soil is very porous and
incapable of retaining water, it is advisable not to divert a
river.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the most vulnerable places in a newly-formed
river-bank are:</p>

<p class='c000'>The ends that join it to the old bank or to the land, to
which it should be thoroughly connected.</p>

<p class='c000'>The toe of the slope and seat, which should be tied into
the bed of the river or be well protected by making the
slope flat towards the base.</p>

<p class='c000'>Any abrupt bends or angles should always be avoided as
they increase erosive action.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wind and water line which requires especial protection.</p>

<p class='c000'>Provided these points are remembered and the usual
precautions taken in forming a river-bank to make it
thoroughly sound and homogeneous, a slip or subsidence of
serious moment is improbable.</p>

<p class='c000'>In order to protect the sandy bed of a river and to prevent
the banks slipping and subsiding, it may be necessary to
guard against scour of the bed and consequently of the toe
of the banks. Stone thrown in will settle and compress
the bed by weighting and consolidation. By periodical
depositions the sand becomes more protected and the
quantity of stone required is reduced, but especial care should
be taken to preserve the normal bed, to offer no obstruction,
and not to cause whirlpools or to interfere with the current
except to direct and train it, or the erosive action so created
will cause movement. Stones simply cast in and allowed to
sink and find a permanent bed until the regular surface of
the bottom of a river is so reached, have been proved in
many instances to be a sure protection in sandy soils provided
eddies do not exist. The preservation of the slopes is
particularly referred to in Chapter VII.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Notes upon the Failure of Dock and other Walls from a
Forward Movement of the Earth Filling or Backing.—Consideration
of the Causes of such Action and some Preventive
and Remedial Measures.</span></p>

<p class='c005'>The most serious consequences often result from slips or
“boils” of sand or loose soil during the construction of
docks, and from the sliding forward or subsidence of quay
walls, as in addition to the great expense of restoring the
damaged wall must be considered the loss of receipts caused
either by delay in opening the docks or from interference
with the traffic. In this chapter no attempt is made to lay
down rules and to declare that if they are followed failures
from pressure, subsidence, or a slip of earth, can be obviated
by careful attention to them. Many of the most renowned
engineers and contractors throughout the world, whose
scientific attainments and practical knowledge are universally
and deferentially acknowledged by those competent to
form a judgment, have had anything but pleasant experiences
in the construction of docks and similar works.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two banes of dockworks may be said to be:—</p>

<p class='c000'>1.  Defective foundations.</p>

<p class='c000'>2.  “Boils,” or the rushing up of loose soil and water in
the foundations.</p>

<p class='c000'>To say that a failure of a dock-wall cannot but be the
result of defective engineering is a statement which it would
be difficult to substantiate. To disturb the earth below the
required depth of the foundations at intervals over the area
of such works in treacherous soils in order to ascertain its
character would simply be to offer a general invitation to it
to commence movement, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vide</span></i> p. <a href='#Page_208'>208</a>. It would be worthy to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>rank with the erudite report of a local committee formed to
declare the best means of preventing floods in a district,
which, after deep consideration reported: “That the
committee were of opinion the floods would be permanently
removed provided the engineer diverts all rivers, streams,
watercourses, and ditches, to the next valley, and closes the
up-stream hole in the hill, or causes the water to be discharged
elsewhere, and reduces the rainfall within the
limits required from time to time by the inhabitants of the
district.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Inasmuch as it is impracticable to ascertain the exact
character and condition of any earth over a large area in
such a location as that usually occupied by a dock, and to be
certain that no unstable seams exist, and as the forces of
nature are infinitely more powerful than those of man, it
cannot be said that a failure is absolutely impossible. All
that can be done is to render improbable any slip or subsidence
by the employment of every known means to promote
stability justified by the importance of the work and with a
due regard to economy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dock-works are peculiarly liable to slips and subsidences
because of their position necessarily being near to the
sea, an estuary, river, or lake, and therefore in usually
treacherous superficial soil of an insecure, water-charged
character. The foundations are also at but comparatively
little depth below the lowest water-level, and although they
are not subject to the frequent vibration railway cuttings
and embankments have to withstand, they are jarred by
blows from vessels and falls of heavy goods, vibration from
cranes and machinery, and also are liable to be suddenly and
unevenly surcharged. The earth backing may also become
quickly water-charged, and a force caused by the tide
varying in height has to be considered in earth embankments
for docks or reclamation purposes, particularly in
sandy or loose soil, namely, that of the foundations being
“blown” up by the upward pressure of the tidal or permanent
head of water above the level of the bottom of the
foundation; thus inside an enclosure embankment, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>cofferdam, a depth of water of 30 feet would give an upward
pressure of, say, 0·85 ton per square foot, and when the
excavation has extended to a depth of 30 feet an insistent
natural weight of a column of sand 1 foot square upon the
foundation has been removed by the excavation equal to
1·65 ton, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vide</span></i> Chapter V. Thus the upward and relieved
pressure 0·85 + 1·65 equals 2·50 tons per square foot, 0·85
ton of which constantly varies. It is obvious that in very
permeable soils, such as sand, the hydrostatic pressure will
be most felt, and should the range of tide be considerable
the strain upon the earth will change and an active
disturbing force be constantly present. This varying
disturbing agent must be seriously considered in all dockwork
or excavation near the sea or a tidal river, and also
approximate to water, for there will always be danger of
the water percolating, and when the foundations are not
sufficiently deep of their being undermined. The weight
and depth must therefore be sufficient to balance or exceed
any upward pressure of the water in the soil due to its head
level. The bottom of the foundation will almost invariably
be below the depth at which water is usually found in the
locality, and it should not be forgotten that sooner or later
the earth upon which dock-walls rest is nearly certain to
become wet and perhaps saturated, and that when saturated
any additional water must flow away. In sandy or loose
soils this may become dangerous. Care must also be taken
in loose soil that it is not loaded by any temporary works so
as to force the earth in any direction, or a slip will occur
and any trenches may become filled, and every effort should
be made to cause equal loading and pressure and to prevent
unequal settlement.</p>

<p class='c000'>The selection of the site of a dock is generally confined
within narrow limits such as railway connection, roads,
location of the want of dock accommodation, currents, the
proper position of the entrances, &amp;c., &amp;c.; nevertheless the
nature of the soil should be considered, for upon a tidal
river a few hundred feet one way or other may cause the
works to be upon various kinds of earth each more or less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>treacherous, and when intermixed perhaps more unstable.
Even upon one side of a comparatively narrow river the
earth may be in a much more stable condition than upon the
other; and when an old watercourse or a dry ditch passes
across the site of a dock it must not be disregarded, as
failures and damage have occurred because the same section
of a wall was continued throughout. It is then necessary to
adopt a system of construction suitable for softer or less
stable ground, and especially so if the wall has to be built
upon a firm stratum overlying sand, as a diminution in the
thickness of the bed may cause a settlement and the wall to
be pushed forward; for there is always danger in sandy soils,
unless the superimposed layer is of considerable thickness,
that the latter may be pierced and the whole site be in
jeopardy from a flow of the sand.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be that a dock must be built at a particular place,
although the ground may be full of springs, the beds inclined,
or a level stratum overlies an inclined bed of rock or softer
earth incapable of standing at any but a flat slope, the whole
being an unstable mass, for the deposits may extend to such
considerable depths that to go below them is impracticable;
however, uniform weighting and consolidation by the deposition
of firm soils having insoluble particles will generally
make it firmer, and by compression and admixture will
ultimately cause the ground to be more solid. It should be
loaded as long as possible, and the material be deposited
beyond the site so as to prevent the outside and less consolidated
earth slipping upon the works, and as it will be
disturbed by the loaded portion having subsided it may
require slight support upon the lower portion of the slope.
When the settlement over the base and the slopes to the
original bed is equal and regular and care is taken that the
soft soil cannot run, by a due protection of its surface it can
be built upon. The rise of the mud in front and for some
distance from the wall is generally from about one-third to
one-half of its subsidence when loaded. The rate of sinking
and uplifting of the soil should be noticed, and whether it is
equable and the depth to which settlement extends is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>same over a considerable area and practically ceases at a
certain depth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Where a dry dock had to be made upon soft fine sand,
Portland cement concrete has been successfully used to cover
the whole site. In such soils, to avoid the danger of the
bottom being blown up when a dock is empty, and has not
the counterbalancing weight of a ship, arrangements should
be made so that sufficient water is let in to counteract the uplifting
force. If it can be avoided it is advisable not to erect
a graving dock upon very porous earth, as the expense of an
impervious lining, whether of Portland cement concrete or
clay puddle, and of keeping it dry will be considerable; and
when unequal settlement takes place a run of the soil may
occur and a slip of earth cause it to become fissured and
separated, especially in an estuary or bay with headlands,
as natural springs may make the sand a quicksand. Much
depends upon the head, if the water comes from the adjoining
hills it may be so great as to prevent any but a strongly
constructed dock, acting as a watertight box, being successful.
The bearing power of the soil will also be practically
the same whether the foundations are a few feet or at a considerable
depth, as the head will be sufficient to make the
springs issue, and therefore disturb the earth.</p>

<p class='c000'>The drainage of the site requires to be carefully
deliberated, and no rules can be laid down, but the flow of
all surface water and springs should be controlled. The chief
aim should be rather to prevent water reaching the site than
to allow it to be present and then pump it away, hence it
is well to have the deepest sump and all water-raising
apparatus, if possible, outside the area of the works of art
and in the direction of the land or river flow. The first
operation in draining the site is to construct the necessary
surface drains around it and also the sinking of<a id='t202'></a> a sump,
cylinder, or wells where required, which to be effectual must
be some few feet deeper than the lowest level of the works of
construction; but the depth should be no more than is
absolutely requisite, as the greater the lift of a pump the less
the efficiency; care being taken that the bottom of the sump
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>is sufficiently low that water gravitates to it, and that the
pumping apparatus is at such a height that it cannot be
“drowned.” When the soil is of so loose a character
that pumping will cause it to “run,” the bottom can be
closed and holes made in the ring and water pumped in
through them, and in addition coarse gravel or broken stone
can be inserted to act as a filter. The act of drainage
may cause soil that has been full of springs to be entirely
free from them, and cannot but always tend to consolidation,
if only because of settlement and the interstices or fissures
being less occupied by water or being reduced in size. In
loose soils, especially at the commencement of pumping
operations, it is advisable that it be not very rapid, as a quick
change of condition may cause the ground to be disturbed too
much, whereas slow pumping may clear the water as
effectually and enable the soil to settle to its new state.
The location of the sump should be at or about the lowest
level of the ground well away from any wall or the dock
area, and on the line of the greatest flow of the land waters
or natural watercourse, thus, dealing with them before they
reach the site of the works.</p>

<p class='c000'>In loose and almost all earth the foundations should be
covered up quickly so as to preserve the natural condition
of the soil. It is also important to offer every possible
support to the earth to prevent initial movement, and slight
assistance may afford the required strength.</p>

<p class='c000'>Unless there are cogent reasons to the contrary, the excavation
for dock-walls is better executed in trenches, the frames
of which being struck as the work progresses can be used
again; the wall can thus be supported by the earth on either
side, and no lateral thrust is brought upon the wall until it
has set, and therefore the danger of bringing, perhaps, the
greatest strain upon it when in an imperfectly solid condition
is obviated, the back and top of the wall being protected
from the weather, and any movement or slip of the earth
prevented; hence a wall should act as quickly as practicable
as a monolithic mass, and the material forming it be
thoroughly bonded and set in Portland cement or the best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>hydraulic lime mortar, or be wholly of strong Portland
cement concrete.</p>

<p class='c000'>The trench system of constructing dock-walls, covered
ways, and all work below ground is the safest to adopt, and
in loose soils or clay that expands and is quickly affected
by atmospheric influences, and where there are buildings
or the ground is weighted, the erection of side walls in
trenches, and then the completion of the invert or arch is
often the only way in which the work can be executed.
Even should the formation be rocky, and the beds be inclined
towards the site, the short 15 to 20 feet in length
trench system is the best to adopt; and it may be advisable
or necessary to work day and night in order that the
ground may be left exposed for the least possible time and
as machine mixed Portland cement concrete walls can be
erected much quicker than masonry or brickwork, in such
situations it is the best material to use. The excavation
for the walls should be confined within the smallest limits,
but no under-cutting should be allowed in the excavation
trenches, or the portion undercut may strain the upper part
and cause it to slip and subside.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Chapter VIII. soft soil or weak ground is referred to,
and as in dockworks this so frequently occurs, the necessity
of making every reasonable provision against undue settlement
is apparent. In such foundations the weight upon
them should be as equable as possible, for any excess of load
will cause subsidence at that place, and a large bearing area
is required which may not be easy to obtain, except by
increasing the area at the back, as the face must be nearly
straight, or only slightly curved, to enable vessels to get
alongside, but the wall should not be the heavier in front
as it will aid an overturning movement. Any dredging
operations should be effected at such a distance that the
stability of a wall cannot be impaired, or a slip of earth may
occur, as the bared soil may commence to “blow” or run
consequent upon the dredging having relieved the ground
of weight and, perhaps, removed an impervious covering.
A row of sheet piles inserted before dredging is commenced,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>if well supported in front, may be sufficient to prevent
movement.</p>

<p class='c000'>In dockwork, the margin allowed to resist lateral strain
being considerable, walls seldom fail by being fractured from
excess of lateral pressure; but either by vertical or lateral
pressure causing subsidence or the whole of a wall to slide
forward upon the foundations; and not from defective form,
workmanship, or materials; but from a compressive strain
upon the face of a wall caused by a force tending to overturn
it; and, as a rule, when a wall inclines towards the face very
little more pressure will upset it. Generally the foundations
are sufficiently firm to support the insistent load, and the
chief cause of failure or undue movement is principally the
result of slipping forward and the want of adhesion of the
soil and frictional resistance of the wall upon it. How can
this forward movement of the earth be prevented? Before
proceeding to name some means that can be employed it
is advisable to remember the cardinal principles of the construction
of dock-walls to resist lateral thrust, because a
structure may be so designed as to induce a movement or a
slip of earth. They may be briefly stated to be as follows:—</p>

<p class='c000'>1.  That the maximum weight is not required in the front
of a dock-wall but at the back, in order that the centre of
gravity may be as far distant from the face as the exigencies
of sound construction will allow.</p>

<p class='c000'>2.  That the centre of gravity should be as low as possible
consistent with the due strength of the upper portions of a
wall so as to increase the resistance to an overturning
movement.</p>

<p class='c000'>3.  To have an equal load upon the ground, and to guard
against any extra strain upon the foundations near the face
of a wall consequent upon the lateral thrust, which has a
tendency to cause a wall to overturn.</p>

<p class='c000'>4.  Particularly to provide against any forward movement
either by having deep foundations, protective works at the
base of a wall, or by other means.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—It is obvious, in order to counteract a sliding movement, that the
foundations should be at right angles to the face batter at the base, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>not be horizontal. These inclining inward foundations, however, can
only conveniently extend for a portion of the width in very thick walls,
but throughout in those of less thickness. When no support is possible in
the front of a wall, such as an extra depth of foundations, an invert, or a
firm connection between the lower portion of opposite dock-walls, &amp;c., it is
advisable to counterfort the wall.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. That the wall should be as symmetrical in form as
possible, particularly upon a soft foundation, in order to
ensure equal loading and settlement, and that it subsides
without a forward movement or tilting.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. That it should be homogeneous, especially when the
strata dip toward it, sufficient provision being made to
prevent any lodgment of water at the back.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. That it must have the usual margin of stability above
the sufficient weight and mass to resist the calculated lateral
thrust of the earth and that caused by it being surcharged
by buildings, goods, cranes, or machinery, which may cause
unequal and sudden loading and strain; and to withstand in
sidelong ground the additional lateral thrust caused by the
inclination of the strata.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. That the face be sufficiently perpendicular to allow
ships to lay close alongside, and that it be of the required
hardness to resist the rubbing of vessels, and especially
of barges.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. That, when a wall is constructed of different materials,
a complete union is effected of all the parts, and anything
tending to make it of varying strength, unless exceptionally
required, should be avoided; such as the junction of lime
concrete with Portland cement concrete, or the employment
of the hardest and strongest bricks or stones and their
connection by means of a weak mortar.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. That the resultant of the vertical and lateral
pressure of the wall, whether surcharged or not, falls well
within the middle third of the wall at its base. If not,
the foundations will be unequally strained.</p>

<p class='c000'>11. That any mooring posts or bollards, gate or sluice
chamber machinery be so placed and secured that they
cause no serious additional strain upon a dock-wall.</p>

<p class='c000'>12. In soils that expand, such as the clays, dry backing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>should be provided of absorbent and even material capable
of compression sufficiently to relieve a wall of severe
pressure from the expansion of the earth.</p>

<p class='c000'>13. That selected material be used for the backing, and
that it be raised in layers inclining in a direction opposite
to that of the wall, care being taken that it cannot become
water-charged.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having briefly referred to a few of the chief principles
of construction of dock-walls, the connection between them
and slips and subsidence in earthwork has to be considered.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is seldom a dock-wall fails from insufficient mass or
incorrect design. The chief element of danger being
imperfect foundations causing a forward movement of the
wall, which may either result in a bulge or a complete
advance of the whole section for a considerable distance, and
usually when this forward motion commences it extends for
a long length, and has an apex, and is not only of a
disastrous character, but also difficult to quickly and
permanently restore to a state of stability. The wall may
be most carefully designed, and be amply sufficient to resist
lateral thrust due to the pressure of the earth and any load
upon the quay, and nevertheless, although as a wall it is
perfect and unimpaired, the whole mass from want of
sufficient depth of the foundations or hold in the ground
frequently slides forward: and there are few extensive
docks that have been constructed in any but the firmest
earth that have been free from such a mishap. In order
to limit the extent of a sliding movement, it might be said,
reduce the lengths of the wall and make the unsupported
from the front length as short as possible, and in doubtful
earth it may be advisable to abandon all long straight walls
and adopt the system of short jetties, with ample width
at their heads for unloading and loading operations, for
a vessel to lay alongside, for store-house room, and a double
line of rails and the necessary free action of machinery; so
as to avoid the expense of slips pushing forward the wall:
but to do this may almost ruin the commercial prospects of
a dock, for naturally owners and captains of ships will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>send their vessels where the greatest facilities are offered and
the impediments to movement the least. Local considerations
in each case alone can determine the shortest required clear
length. However, in designing jetties to dock-walls it is
advisable to so construct them that they may act also as
face counterforts to a wall, and be located at any apparently
weak place so as to give support where it is needed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chief danger is from variation of the earth in the
foundations and the existence of thin seams of an unstable
character, or fissures in rocky soil allowing percolation of
water, most difficult, if not bordering upon the impossible,
to discover unless by trial pits and borings over the whole
area of the site of a dock, which would be a most unwise
proceeding, as has been previously named in this chapter.
The marvellous labours of geologists and others have
enabled an accurate opinion to be formed of the locality and
the depth at which water and certain minerals are to be
found and also to indicate the earths in which fissures and
seams are frequent; but it must ever be impossible for man
to absolutely state that no unstable seams or veins exist over
a considerable area of ground, more especially in the superficial
beds upon which a dock-wall has to be constructed,
although the probability of their presence may be determined
with some degree of precision. The importance of a
complete examination of the ground of the site and neighbourhood
is imperative, and particularly of any cuttings and
embankments in the locality.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Chapter II. many conditions of earth are referred to in
which slips and movement are probable, but that now under
consideration is usually caused by a wall resting upon seams
or weak veins of unstable soil; therefore, there is danger
when a comparatively thin seam of soft slimy earth interposes
between the hard bed upon which the foundations may rest
and one below the vein; for, but a little additional moisture
may sufficiently lubricate the surface to enable the firm bed
to slide upon it, the frictional resistance being thereby so
reduced that movement results. Similarly, in the case of a
seam of gravel overlying clay, the firm gravel bed may slide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>upon the clay: the foundations should then be carried down
to the clay. Piles at the base driven into the gravel will be
of little use; in fact, for permanent work, they are now almost
abandoned except for jetties, cills, aprons, dolphins, &amp;c., for
uniformity of support is very difficult to obtain in pilework
and cannot be proved to exist; but piles may be useful to
help to sustain a structure until it has taken its permanent
bearing and is in possession of its full strength. For purposes
of permanent support they are somewhat unreliable,
for failures have happened because of their weakness, and
walls have consequently been overturned; their chief use
is as auxiliary temporary aids to lateral stability, such
as confining concrete or lessening the percolation of water.
However, the earth may be in such a condition that it cannot
retain them in position when they are strained, then they are
useless for lateral support. Their resistance to horizontal
strain varies much with the nature of the soil and not
necessarily according to its cohesive power; for instance,
experiments have shown sand to afford the greatest horizontal
resistance; clay, less; and in loose ashes the power is further
reduced.</p>

<p class='c000'>When a clay stratum is thin and overlies gravel or sand,
provided the necessary precautions are taken that the sand
does not “boil,” it is better to have the foundations upon the
underlying gravel or sand, as the layer of clay may bulge
and slide upon the gravel and thrust out the wall. Should
a stratum of clay be superimposed upon another of similar
character, it will always be in a damp state conducive to
lateral instability, as there will be two sliding surfaces, and
the upper may be forced forward and carry the wall with
it, and should a seam of sand be interposed it may become
“quick” and flow away. In such cases the foundations
should extend to a safe depth in the lower clay stratum or
be below the unstable seam, and when the depth of silt or
unstable soil overlying a firm bed, as rock, is considerable, the
well system can be adopted, provided the bottom is levelled.
As seams, weak veins, and fissures are so frequently met with
the examples might be continued almost <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</span></i>. To
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>ascertain whether they exist and their location is one of the
primary precautions to be observed, as dock-walls usually
fail from bulging or slipping forward, causing fracture or
overturning.</p>

<p class='c000'>Additional weight or increase of the thickness of a wall
may not suffice to arrest movement of the base or forward
motion of the earth. To place the foundations at a greater
depth may be impracticable, although it may be the best
method of restoration; it then becomes necessary to insert an
invert or strut between the walls in a narrow dock, or in a
large dock to attempt to remove the unstable seam in front
of the wall and prevent movement of the vein by a curtain-wall,
additional weight, or other means of consolidation; or
by removing the solid backing, draining the back, and the
erection of a timber platform instead of the earth, so that it
reposes at its natural slope without creating a thrust upon
the wall; or by having packed rubble filling instead of
ordinary solid backing so as to remove or lighten the lateral
pressure upon it, by draining the ground at the back; or by
counterforts from the foundation to the ground level, at the
front of the wall, especial care being taken to prevent their
parting from the main wall.</p>

<p class='c000'>The arched wall system is sometimes adopted for docks,
but as it requires a longer time to construct, and is obviously
more liable to be damaged from settlement and by pressure
of the earth and the failure of joints and weak places, solid
walls of Portland cement concrete with a hard face are more
to be desired; as in such situations a monolithic and equally
resisting mass is required, weight and mass being of importance.
The relative bulk of materials for a certain expenditure
should be considered, as it may happen that greatly increased
weight and mass may be obtained for no extra expense by
the employment of a certain substance. Combinations of
brickwork and masonry and concrete are being abandoned in
favour of one homogeneous material throughout, and no yet
known aggregate fulfils this condition for such work as Portland
cement concrete, owing to the difficulty of making secure
and perfect joints, although hard brick facing may be necessary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>to protect the face from wear by the rubbing of vessels. By
a judicious adoption of material for a dock-wall in order to
give it weight and mass, and sufficiently deep foundations,
neither counterforts nor other special means of protection
against failure may be required, and slips and movements of
the earth may be prevented.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the case of a stratum of soft soil of considerable depth
overlying a firm foundation, dock and quay-walls upon arches,
not exceeding about 30 feet span, have been successfully
erected upon wells sunk in or to the solid ground, when by
reason of the cost it was impracticable to carry a solid wall
to the firm ground; and no slipping, sliding forward, or
subsidence has occurred.</p>

<p class='c000'>To prevent movement of the earth at the back of a wall
pushing or fracturing it and being the cause of a slip, it
may be well to briefly state a few points to which attention
should be especially directed.</p>

<p class='c000'>In adopting two systems of design of a wall, it is advisable
that the change of form be gradual and not made abruptly,
or cracks may occur from unequal settlement or load upon
the foundations, and also when a concrete bed is used under
a wall a lime concrete layer cannot be firmly joined to one
composed of more solid and unyielding material, such as
Portland cement concrete. Similar walls erected upon different
soils are not equally strained, as one earth may scarcely
change from the effects of air and water, and another may
vary daily according to the weather.</p>

<p class='c000'>To counteract any overturning tendency, a wall should
have a large bearing area under the face portion, all projections
and heavy copings should be avoided, or anything that
increases the load near the face at the top. Weight and
width of base and considerable depth of foundations are most
important, for well designed walls when placed upon stable
ground have been pushed forward simply from an insufficiently
deep hold in the ground; and the load upon the
earth must be within its safe bearing power. A wall should
be designed so that its centre of gravity is as far from the face
as practicable, and when it is constructed of stone or brick
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>it is necessary that the joints be as strong as possible, and
be capable of resisting varying strains. Should lime mortar
be used it is probable it will be partly washed out, and Portland
cement mortar should always be preferred upon the
face, or water may percolate into the wall and even pass
through it to the earth and cause slips and subsidences.</p>

<p class='c000'>Counterforts erected upon the outer face of retaining walls
are much to be preferred to any placed at the back, for
support at the face is what is required: in the latter case
there is always a chance of their becoming separated from the
main wall, although when so located at the back they are considered
to lessen the lateral pressure of the earth by dividing
it, but any reduction caused by friction of the soil against
the sides may vary so greatly, according to the condition and
subsidence of the earth, that it is prudent to disregard it, and
it is well to remember that the pressure may become intensified
or uneven upon the main wall by deflection and concentration
caused by the counterforts, the result being the
creation of weak and unduly strained places; it may therefore
be better to uniformly increase the thickness of the wall.
Counterforts of triangular shape on plan have been adopted
in order to lessen the lateral thrust by directing it to the
sides of the triangles, their bases being against the wall.
It is doubtful whether the thrust of the earth so acts under
the usual varying conditions of work. The necessity of
mooring vessels alongside a dock or quay-wall prevents the
adoption of face counterforts except to a very limited extent;
however, although the form of a ship permits of only a slight
batter for the upper half, the lower portion may be inclined
for a few feet from the bottom. As the adoption of a batter
on the face increases the area of the base of a wall and its
frictional surface upon the ground, and tends to lessen overturning
movement and undue strain upon the face, a dock,
quay, or retaining wall having a batter is to be preferred to
one with a vertical face; in fact, it acts as a triangular front
counterfort, with the great advantage of being an inherent
part of a wall.</p>

<p class='c000'>In foundations of a sandy or silty character, a dock or quay-wall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>having wells in the cross section to within a few feet of
its base filled with rammed light dry material, the width of
the bottom nearly approaching that of the depth of water,
has been adopted in preference to a solid wall of less thickness,
as affording a wider base, greater resistance to overturning,
and a reduction of the weight upon the foundations.</p>

<p class='c000'>A slip of the earth backing is frequently caused from
insufficient drainage and a consequent accumulation of water
behind a wall, producing such pressure that the friction of
the weight of the wall upon the foundations is impaired and
the support in front insufficient to resist a forward movement,
therefore the back drainage should receive due attention.
When a dock-wall has been thrust forward by the earth it
may be a serious movement, likely to increase and culminate
in the destruction of the wall, or be merely a slight lateral
settlement. Such slips are usually of considerable length, and
have an apex where the greatest forward motion has occurred.
The chief remedies consist in securing the foundations, supporting
the face, lightening or removing the pressure of the
backing, draining the backwaters and preventing their
reaching the wall. Provided a wall is intact and not
damaged, but solidly and horizontally pushed forward, it need
not be taken down, but if vertical subsidence has taken place,
or a settlement, at the face only, it is generally of serious
importance, and it may be necessary to remove and replace it.</p>

<p class='c000'>When a wall bulges slightly from the pressure of the
earth at the back and then ceases to move, the ground
behind may have become in a state of permanent equilibrium,
and the lateral thrust, which before movement was
too great, may be so reduced that in the altered position
it may remain stable, provided the void is filled with light
porous backing, and the drainage of the earth receives due
attention. Counterforts of piles reaching to the level of
the ground in front of the face have been adopted to arrest
and prevent a forward movement, but when the ground is
much disturbed and in a loose state, it is unadvisable to
drive piles because of vibration which may induce further
motion. Instead of timber pile counterforts, trenches might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>be cut at intervals along the toe and be filled with quick-setting
cement concrete, the filling to follow the excavation
as closely as possible, and no unsupported earth to be
allowed to remain.</p>

<p class='c000'>As improper backing often induces a slip and subsidence
of the earth and the failure of a wall, it is of importance
that it should be carefully executed, for many well-designed
walls have failed or bulged from being badly and hurriedly
backed with unsuitable and soft retentive material in a
deteriorated condition, the result being movement of the
earth. Care should be taken that the material of which the
backing is composed will always maintain the slope of
repose upon which the calculations have been based that
determined the dimensions of the wall; therefore, it should
always have an angle of repose which is not much affected
by moisture. It is important to remember that according
to the nature of the backing so will be the pressure upon
a wall, depending principally upon the coefficient of
friction of the earth upon similar earth, its cohesion, its
friction upon the surface of the back of a wall, the inclination
of the layers, the general character of the soil and the
effect of moisture upon it; and no vegetable, decayed, or
“made” earth should be used for such a purpose, nor
material which gives a varying thrust according to the
state of dampness or dryness, and the lightest dry, firm,
and stable earth should be preferred. When rubble backing
is adopted and is carefully packed, the lateral thrust may
be greatly reduced, as in some degree, instead of backing
a dry wall may be considered to have been built at the back
of the face wall. Clean ashes are an excellent material
for filling damp places in a wall, because they not only
absorb moisture, but are light, and stand permanently at a
slope of about 1 to 1 <span class='fss'>TO</span> 1¼ to 1, but they can seldom be
obtained in sufficient quantity to be used in considerable
masses; also broken bricks and burnt ballast, although
heavier, make good backing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Earth that is much affected by air or water, or that
expands, contracts, or fissures, such as clay, is not good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>for filling, and dry masonry retaining walls should not be
hacked with earth but with rubble, or in countries with
a heavy rainfall the wall will most probably be forced
forward.</p>

<p class='c000'>Care should be taken to have plenty of weep-holes in a
wall so as to obviate any accumulation of water, and it is
well if the back has a rough face in order to increase friction
and prevent cavities in the backing down which water may
percolate. During construction a few weep-holes in a dock
or quay-wall should always be provided, until the water
is to be let in to a dock, when it is best to fill them with
strong Portland cement concrete as water would proceed
along them from the face and accumulate at the back of a
wall; the permanent drainage being affected by other means.</p>

<p class='c000'>In pulling down walls that have been built with offsets
at the back it will usually be noticed that the filling does
not rest upon them, but that hollows occur as the earth
subsides; for this reason, a straight batter at the back is to
be preferred. No support from the weight of the earth,
which is supposed to be upon them, should be relied upon,
although it may temporarily exist.</p>

<p class='c000'>The filling should be commenced at the wall, and the
layers be so deposited that their slope approximates to that
of being at right angles to the surface of the slope of the
ground rather than parallel to it. When thought desirable
and the natural ground is solid, it can be benched, and the
backing be damped and rammed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The backing of a wall may consist not only of an inverted
triangular piece of earth, but extend for some distance to
the rear, and may have a top surface at a considerable height
above it; the wall will then have to sustain a severe thrust.
The angle of repose of the earth should be ascertained and
the filling be thoroughly drained, or it may be disintegrated
by moisture, the whole mass gradually become unstable, and
finally push the wall forward with great force.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Notes upon Slips of Earth, Subsidences and Movement in Foundations
caused by “Boils” or an Upward Rush of Water in
Loose Earths.—Consideration of some Precautionary and
Remedial Operations.</span></p>

<p class='c005'>With regard to “boils” in sandy soils and the general
drainage of the site of dockworks, operations should be
commenced as long as possible before the works of construction,
so as to lessen the probability of the occurrence
of slips, subsidences, and movement of earthwork. In order
to reduce infiltration, it is well to make a trench round the
area of any ground that has to be excavated, which may
embrace the whole site. A system of drains and conduits
should be established within it, and at the lowest level a
sump at a convenient position, and to a depth a few feet
below that of the work; it can then be made the chief pumping
station of the dock; but all drawing away or flow of
the earth must be prevented: and to obviate erosion of the
drains, they may require to be rough lined with an impervious
covering such as clay. The sump should consist of an
iron cylinder with proper provision against a run of soil.
In all loose earths the pumping station should be some
distance from buildings or roads so as to avoid any settlement.</p>

<p class='c000'>When a choice of sites exists and the position of a dock
is not absolutely fixed, it may be possible to have the
foundations of the whole work in one kind of earth; if
otherwise, one portion may be stable and another unstable,
always treacherous, and liable to slip and subside. In any
case settlement is not likely to be equal, and therefore a foundation
which is well able to sustain an evenly distributed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>load may yield from unequal strain and excess of lateral
thrust. Consequent upon the situation of docks, the superficial
beds upon which they have to be erected frequently
vary in stability and reliability; and the location being
altered in any direction may result most seriously; the
earth upon one side of a comparatively narrow river being
stable in character and on the opposite bank most
treacherous. Difficulties often arise in foundations, especially
in sandy soils, from making borings and trial pits
too near the important parts of the work; they should
be made as reasonably far away as is convenient. In
boring, a sand flow may occur, when it may be necessary
to fill the bore-hole and sustain the soil by a covering, or
by consolidating the sand by means of Portland cement,
and then, perhaps, reliable operations may be continued.
Borings should be considered as unreliable if merely superficial;
in any case of importance they should only be trusted
for the place where they are made, and not as indicating
the nature or condition of the soil over a considerable
area. When pits cannot be sunk, it is desirable that in a
suspectedly treacherous site the bore-holes should be at
every 200 or 300 feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>Excavating pits, using test-bars, and driving piles are
some of the methods of determining the character of foundations,
but care should be taken to ascertain in boring that
boulders, or thin strata of hard gravel, are not mistaken
for solid rock. In sand, mud, or soft clay they can be made
by means of an iron pipe and the water-jet system.
Experience has proved that boring with an auger is not
so reliable as boring with a tube, such as is used for artesian
wells. In the case of augers, when boulders are encountered,
further boring is usually arrested in that place and
another bore-hole has to be commenced. Trial pits, where
practicable, should be preferred to boring, and they should be
sunk to a depth considerably below the lowest level of the
intended foundations, and then they may do for sump holes
for pumping operations. In testing ground by borings,
several should be made, as one hole might encounter a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>boulder or some hard soil, such as indurated clay, and the
latter may adhere to the auger and arrest its progress; the
specimens then brought up, being crushed and pressed
together, will appear to be firmer than the actual condition
of the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having briefly referred to the preliminary drainage, and
some methods of ascertaining the nature of the ground, the
former to lessen, and the latter to aid discovery of the
character of any probable upward lushes of soil: “boils”
in foundations are more specifically considered. It may be
said that they generally proceed from an impervious top
stratum being pierced, thereby tapping the water in a
pervious bed which may be imposed upon another impervious
layer; for the upper bed being excavated removes
the weight upon the lower strata and induces a flow of the
previously confined water.</p>

<p class='c000'>The source of disturbance may be either from surface-water
in the top soil or from deep underground springs,
depending in great measure upon the extent of the catchment
area and head-water level of the district, as its quantity and
uplifting pressure will be principally governed by them.
When the soil is in a delicate state of equilibrium it only
requires a slight deteriorating alteration of the normal
condition to initiate a movement. The disturbance of the
ground may be merely superficial, nevertheless its effect may
be sufficient to start a “boil,” although the chief cause
potently exists at some considerable depth and distance.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Boils” produced by simply surface-water require one
system of treatment; if from underground waters, another
remedy is necessary. Every effort should be made to know
the reason, trace the origin, and to ascertain the power of
the disturbing forces. It may be possible to determine them,
although generally it can only be done by deductive reasoning
and logical inference. In any event immediate action
is invaluable when a “boil” appears. Weighting the ground
around a “boil” with an impervious mass of clay, and the
insertion of a stand-pipe will indicate the level to which the
water will rise, varying according to the seasons, and will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>give an approximate idea of the head supply and pressure;
care being taken that the pipe does not become obstructed
and that the water has a free flow. It may also be
ascertained by the insertion of pipe-rods to different depths,
and by noticing the effects, such as the rapidity, the quantity
and the character of the discharge. There may be an
appreciable difference in the height to which the water rises
in various stand-pipes; if so, its flow is obstructed or the
source is not identical. An examination of the colour and
nature of the suspended matter in the water and a comparison
of it with the strata may show its source, but it is
not always reliable unless the same colour is maintained for
the lowest depths.</p>

<p class='c000'>A perusal of Chapter II. will indicate some situations in
which “boils” may be expected. The conditions under
which they may appear are so numerous that it may be
stated they generally occur in any situation when a layer of
loose soil has a superimposed bed of more or less impervious
boil upon it which is perforated by the excavation for a dock
or other work; and especially should a water-bearing stratum,
such as chalk, underlie a sand stratum; also when a water-bearing
stratum is superimposed upon sand which lies upon
an impervious bed such as clay, as water will percolate to the
sand; and when sand overlies a water-charged stratum; or
at the outcrop of chalk hills near the site; or where sand is
below an impervious layer of clay and the latter is tapped.
The “boils,” of course, become more serious as the head of
water increases, and also when the strata dip towards the site.</p>

<p class='c000'>An impervious bed may be of such thickness, that when
the lowest foundation is excavated there may be no fear of
water from any underground source being forced up through
it; however, unless the thickness of the upper layer is known
to be nearly uniform over the site of a dock, which is seldom
the case, the water pressure, aided by the weight of the
structure, may separate or loosen the soil at a weak place,
and then a “boil” will be the result. The thickness of the
crust required, which may be anything from about 15 feet
upward, may be approximately ascertained by weighting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>the earth considerably above the load it will permanently
have to sustain, and by watching the subsidence and general
effect. Great care should be taken not to perforate the firm
stratum, as danger will at once ensue should loose soil, such
as sand, be tapped, for cavities will then be produced causing
subsidence, probable fracture of the firm stratum, “boils,”
and slips of serious extent. When a heavy structure has to
be built upon such a soil, and it is impossible because of the
expense to place the foundations except upon this superficial
bed, experiments in the direction indicated should always be
made, and any other means of proof that circumstances may
allow other than by perforation of the stratum: in any case
every effort should be made to reliably ascertain that the
firm stratum is of uniform depth and character.</p>

<p class='c000'>The discharge channel of any underground waters likely
to disturb the foundations should be discovered, and when
there are adjacent hills, by tracing their dampest part the
probable direction of the surface flow may become known.
Inquiry should be made to find out whether any borings have
been made over the site in order to determine if the “boils”
have been artificially created or are natural blow-wells, in
which the water rises over the top and can, perhaps, be led
away by gravitation. It is advisable to fill every bore-hole
with Portland cement mortar before any excavation is commenced,
or they will burst out when the surrounding ground
is disturbed. Bags containing shot have been used to help to
close a hole, but a preferable method is to insert a pipe down
the bore, it having been previously cleared of all dirt; and
to fill it with neat Portland cement mortar, the tube being
raised as the hole is filled. Such a method, although successful
with small holes, is useless in the case of “blows” of
the ordinary size. A permanent shaft or cylinder is then
necessary.</p>

<p class='c000'>With regard to the treatment of “boils” in foundations,
when in the possession of the information hereinbefore named
it may indicate a remedy either for “boils” in which the
cause of disturbance is at a considerable depth and the head
and fall of water moderately large, or when the agitation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>is merely superficial, which may result from the range of the
tidal waters or the want of surface drainage.</p>

<p class='c000'>When a “boil” is of the first order, it is useless attempting
to simply stop it by force and prevent the issue of water, as
such a method of procedure would result in merely diverting
the disturbance, and in addition leave a weak place in the
foundations; however, if many “boils” appear, and the
disintegrating agency of the water is removed either by
conducting or diverting the flow from the site, they can then
be filled, and it should be simultaneously effected, or any
mere exudation in the whole of the “boils” may become
increased in one or two to a flow sufficient to cause a slip or
instability, and any concentration of the discharge may
produce movement of the ground. Small springs or “boils”
have been sufficiently arrested by depositing clay over them,
excavating it, and putting in the foundations very promptly
and before the “boil” burst out again; such treatment,
however, may lead to the backing of a wall becoming
saturated and the water being dammed up: on the other
hand, the “boil” may be sealed and the water flow away in
the original underground channels; also when a “boil” is
tapped it may induce an increased flow of the underground
waters, for they will find the course of least resistance; and
should they reach a fine sand stratum will filter through and
set it in motion, provided the head is sufficient to overcome
friction; and the support rendered to any overlying stratum
will therefore be destroyed.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the event of there being only one “boil,” but that of
important extent, perhaps the best way to proceed is to place
clay upon the surface for a few feet around it, the weight of
which should not be less than the normal pressure of the earth
removed by excavation, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vide</span></i> Chapter V.: and by the insertion
of a cylinder, with a properly designed bottom, to prevent
the issue of soil to a level some feet below the lowest
intended excavation upon the site, or to the depth at which
the greatest flow of water is obtained; care being taken that
no run of sand or soil is allowed and that the water is not
charged with earth, either by a thick gravel layer until the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>sand ceases to pass through it, or by other means, remembering
that the motive power of running sand is that of the
pressure of water. The flow should be gently led away, if
necessary, to a sump, and discharged by pumping, thus draining
the works. The sump should always be lined, not only
to prevent any flow upon or into the surface causing saturation,
but so as to control and regulate the water some feet
below the lowest level of the foundations, the great point
being to draw downwards the water from the earth and then
to carry it away. An iron or wooden cylinder sump is to be
preferred to one constructed of sheet piles or timber-lined, as
the soil may be so loose that any shaking or vibration should
not be allowed, and a close joint is not easy to attain in
timber pile work. It is well to deposit some clay puddle for
a little distance round the sump after sinking it in order to
weight the soil and steady the cylinder. When a discharging
outlet has been made it should be maintained in perfect
condition, or a slip or subsidence may occur from leakage or
diversion of the flow. It may also happen that no discharge
is necessary, for if the “boil” is only, as it were, of local
extent and caused by a weak vein in otherwise stable soil,
the water may rise to the head level and there remain; the
equilibrium being restored which had been destroyed by
reason of the upper strata of an impervious character being
excavated. The removal of the normal pressure upon the
loose soil to some extent, liberates the water, and the head
ceasing to be balanced by it, the earth cannot do otherwise
than allow water to upraise it. A calculation of the weight
of the earth removed may give an indication within which
will be the probable head level of the supply, and usually it
is much below a head of water that would equal the normal
pressure of the soil. Supposing the weight of the earth to
be twice that of water, when 10 feet of soil is excavated
before a “boil” began, its removal would approximately be
equivalent to a 20 feet head of water.</p>

<p class='c000'>The great point is to confine a “boil” within a certain
space, and there to treat it and so prevent the appearance
of others and interruption to the prosecution of the works.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>All agitation of the surface of sand, especially when a “boil”
appears, must be prevented, as inducing a disturbed and
more porous condition.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the seat of a “boil” must be built over, the well
system of foundations can be used as not only affording
reliable support, but also preventing a “boil” extending,
and allowing the flow of water to be discharged, care being
taken that complete connection is made with a wall constructed
upon any other principle. If “boils” appear over
a considerable area, it is evident that the disturbance is
general, and may either be because the site or the foundations
of the works are below the level at which water is
usually found in the district, or be produced by the rise and
fall of tidal waters. When by the former, drains are
required a few feet below the general water-bearing level,
and they should intercept the percolation of the land waters
and conduct them from the site of the works, or so gently
localize them that they can be treated as before described.
The land waters are the most troublesome because their
volume, time of appearance, and duration of flow will vary,
whereas the range of the tidal waters is known, and therefore
the effects may be ascertained with some approach to
accuracy.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be impossible to erect walls in very loose soils
without encircling the site with sheet piles to prevent a run
of sand, to lessen “blows” and to reduce the disturbance,
as placing them upon an impervious stratum maybe prohibitory
because of the expense: but the adoption of the well
system of foundations down to a firm stratum, or at a
sufficient depth to be stable, and the building walls thereon
may cause the temporary pile support to be unnecessary
and prevent a slip or subsidence. Quick erection and the
least exposure or disturbance of earth are essentials in
such cases.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the use of Portland cement concrete, foundations can
now be cheaply obtained with the ground in a wet condition,
which in the days when it was considered only suitable
for secondary works, would have required the employment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>of expensive methods of construction. It may be unwise to
arrest the upward flow of the tidal waters in loose soil
except by intercepting, lessening, or preventing it by shore
protection, for the upward pressure of the head of water
may “blow” up the earth and cause disturbance; on the
other hand, should the “boils” be merely superficial and
the head very little, a thick watertight covering of Portland
cement concrete, when accompanied by the necessary
drainage operations, may suffice; the surface water blows
being covered, and the pressure of the water being overbalanced
by the superimposed weight.</p>

<p class='c000'>All works to prevent “boils” or to drain waters from
the site should, if possible, be executed prior to the excavation,
as the effect of draining can then be observed and
whether any “boils” arise from land waters or from a tidal
flow, and the earth will have had some time in which to
subside and become consolidated. A month’s test will
afford some criterion in a variable climate and when changes
of weather are frequent; but should a long period of
drought prevail it may be no indication of the state in
which the earth would be in a wet season, or under ordinary
meteorological influences; and further, the land waters may
take a considerable time in flowing to the shore, depending
upon the catchment area, character of the soil, position of
the beds, whether the district is drained or not, and many
other local conditions.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the soil is firm clay, the locality of any leakage
or water seam in it will usually be indicated by surface
exudation over the water-charged vein; also in nearly all
compact earth, particularly if of a clayey or loamy nature,
and therefore the seat of disturbance may not have to be
discovered as in looser or sandy soils.</p>

<p class='c000'>Should a water-bearing fissure occur in rock and it be
necessary to stop it, there being no danger of diverting the
flow to another place upon the site of the works, it can be
done by means of neat Portland cement mortar pressed
down and kept in place by timber strips, weights or other
means until it has set; the face of the fissure should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>made as clean as possible, and the water-bearing seam be
filled and weighted directly a leak appears, or the flow may
become much increased and accelerated and a current of
water be induced which may become of serious extent.</p>

<p class='c000'>To avoid slips and movement of the ground when it is
necessary that a water-charged bed of sand be excavated
to enable a structure to be built upon a firm impervious
stratum below it, sheet piles can be used or corrugated
iron sheets, strutted at intervals, so as to prevent a run and
slip of sand; and the space between them can be excavated,
a Portland cement concrete foundation being inserted upon
the firm soil, the wall being erected in lengths, and the
piles or case being practically three-sided so as to leave no
unsupported surface of sand, care being taken to prevent
any run between the front and the back of the last built
length of wall and the earth, so that each length is erected
in a contained area.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
